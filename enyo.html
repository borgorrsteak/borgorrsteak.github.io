The river was bristling with vessels. A few of the bigger quays thronged with cranes constantly loading and unloading cargo, bobbing like feeding birds. Barges and tugs swarmed through, headed further upriver. The clay of Kelsbury was gouged by narrow, deep channels from the river, where it all pooled as huge culs-de-sac into the riverside city. These fat square docks and reservoirs hosted smaller riverside markets. Sampans and small ferries sold fresh fish and produce by the riverside. 

And as was customary with Enyo’s routine in Emerald, he stopped by Kelsbury to do his rounds. Ordering victuals, negotiating cuts with the customs agents, bribing the local militia. He glanced down from a balcony. From where he sat in the al fresco tables of a local gastropub, the crew of the Haraita were lugging casks and crates out of the establishment. They hefted it over to the quay where their much smaller supply ship was tied. That was their months store of liquor solved.

But one thing was out of the ordinary today. 

“Did a number on it, did ya?” 

The waitress made idle conversation as he set down the coffee Enyo ordered. 

“Hm? Oh. This?” Enyo glanced up without moving his head. His fingers touched  at his left horn. While it was taped together (barely) and kept upright, the skin around the base had a slight swell, suggesting an internal infection developing. He had’t the faintest what to do with it. It was just his bad luck that Isawa retired right as he took the injury. And given his record, admittance to a regular hospital or clinic was out of the question. “Rough fall.”

“Uhuh. That’s what they all say,” she sighed in a way that suggested she didn’t buy it. Then her face crinkled with sour disgust, at the young girl sitting adjacent to Enyo. “That your kid?”

Enyo never bothered to tell acquaintances about his divorce. It was old news. He was here on business. Isawa gave him a name for a temp replacement, in exchange for taking on this runt as a last favor.

“Hah, no,” he smiled, crossing his arms on the table, “Just some kid looking for a job in ours. Hey Mia, can I ask you something?” 

The waitress nodded. Porcelain clinked as she collected the <span style="font-style:italic">rather numerous</span> buildup of empty plates on Enyo’s table. Wiped clean of crumbs. Obnoxiously, the sound of chewing, cheek smacking, and food squelching from inside her mouth drilled on. She’d finished three whole entrees before Enyo even received his coffee. The fourth was being scarfed down through shovelfuls of oily fingers. The scrawny girl kept her head down and sat hunched over her food, as if afraid it’d be taken away. 

Enyo jerked a thumb out to the sunless horizon. He was gesturing to the ghostly outline of the river bridge, glowing a sickly hue from the green lights. Clotted around it were dark shapes. A mass of people collected at both ends, keeping the cargo trucks from passing through. In the distance, he could see a few jump off into the water below, leaping off hind legs with webbed feet and bent legs. 

“What’s going on there?” 

With pursed lips, a fearful expression struck her face. Mia glanced around, then bent down to whisper. 

“Word’s the vodyanoi are organizing a strike.” 

“Oh.”

But all he could think about about was, <span style="font-style:italic">Fuck. What if he’s a frog?</span> He worked with vodyanoi before, sure. But Enyo dreaded the thought of his injury being touched by sticky, mucousal hands. 

He didn’t even notice Mia leave with a tense smile and nimble steps, too frightened to talk more because the militia had eyes and ears everywhere.

From the gentle stirring from slumber to the caress of a cleansing bath, the tender choreography of hair brushing, and the deliberate relish of morning sustenance, each action unfolded in a symphony of routine. It was a rhythm of existence that had been danced to for countless years, a dance of familiarity and comfort that unfolded like the delicate unfurling of a blossom.

Yet amidst this tranquil cadence, there was a purpose to his steps beyond mere habit. For as the morning light bathed the world in its golden hues, the Nymph ventured forth into the verdant embrace of the woods, his quest set upon the gathering of herbs. Here, amidst the dappled shadows and whispered secrets of the forest, he would spend hours in quiet communion with nature, plucking both common and rare botanical treasures from the earth's embrace. Each herb, a testament to the healing arts he practiced, destined to find its place upon the shelves of his abode, ready to be transformed into remedies for those in need.

And yet, despite the arcane prowess that lay within his grasp, the Nymph found himself pondering a curious conundrum. For in his wisdom, he could not comprehend why some beings shunned the embrace of magical healing. Was not the touch of magic a balm without equal, swift in its efficacy, gentle in its touch, and leaving no scars to mar the flesh? And yet, in deference to the respect of others, he refrained from delving too deeply into the recesses of their hearts, content to respect their choices, even as the question lingered like a whisper upon the breeze.

In the tapestry of his days, there existed a thread of fascination that wove its way through the fabric of routine. For though others might find solace in the predictability of their lives, the Nymph found joy in the serendipitous enc</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1218618510993915984"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, March 17, 2024 01:54:53 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1218618510993915984">01:54:53</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-6">ounters that awaited him within the embrace of the forest. Each day brought with it the promise of new discoveries; from the tender ministrations to an injured creature to the silent communion with ancient trees, each moment a brushstroke upon the canvas of existence.

A letter, delivered by the claws of a trusted pigeon, bore tidings of a journey yet uncharted, a voyage upon the restless sea. And though the prospect filled him with trepidation, he knew that duty called him forth, beckoning him towards a path unknown. And so, with a heart heavy with anticipation, he made ready his preparations, the weight of uncertainty hanging heavy upon his shoulders.

As the hour of departure drew near, the Nymph bid farewell to the woodland creatures who had become his steadfast companions, whispering words of reassurance as he promised his swift return. And as he stepped into the carriage that would carry him towards the shore, he could not shake the feeling of unease that clung to him like a shadow. Yet, even amidst the uncertainty, there burned within him a spark of resolve, a determination to meet whatever challenges lay ahead with grace and fortitude.

Though his farewells elongated his departure, he arrived punctually, stepping out of the vehicle with gratitude for the carriage driver and determination to fulfill his commitment.

Observing a man seated at a table occupied by another young girl, Xueyi's gaze settled upon the merchant described in Isawa's missives. Assuming him to be Enyo, the individual he sought, Xueyi extended a courteous greeting that was followed by a soft tap on his shoulder. <strong>"Good day."</strong> he began in a gentle tone, a soft smile adorning his lips as he addressed the Shifter. <strong>"You are... Enyo, correct? Isawa has entrusted me with a letter, requesting my assistance as the temporary healer for your crew. Might I take a seat?"</strong> His inquiry was accompanied by a subtle tilt of his head, indicating his readiness to embark on this new endeavor.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1218843028257640478"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/1186058056740634674/ac1a4bd3980bbe538a03b6102ad3f363.png" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: Enyo Hiyotsuke

She remained ignorantly scarfing down her meal, sticking a provided metal hook into a boiled giant conch. Each chew revealed razor sharp, serrated teeth. Inhuman. More like what a shark had. There was no need for the knife and fork to chew through the rubbery shellfish. Grubby fingers dipped chunks into the seafood broth. 

"Hey," he intoned softly, "Slow down kid. You're gonna choke." 

Regardless, she paid no heed. But she did notice Xueyi stalk from behind long before contact was made on Enyo's shoulder. 

Startled, the dragon whipped his head back, craning his neck to look up at Xueyi behind him. *Ouch*. The slightest movement caused a sudden stab of pain on the left side of his temples. He winced. 

"Oh, it's you. Guess Isawa described me down to a T," Enyo laughed the wince off. Well, not that Enyo wasn't a hard man to find in a crowd. The long, white hair gave it away. That, and prior description of his taped up horn was the cincher. 

He was unabashedly relieved that Xueyi <span style="font-style:italic">wasn't</span> a squat old vodyanoi with bulging eyes, huge blubbery lips and bent Anuran legs. He was pretty, even, in Enyo's quick estimation. Young, possibly. Then again, he could never quite figure it just by one look. Aging of different species differed. For all he knew, Xueyi could be a century old. 

Beside Enyo, the young girl went back to minding her own, gradually adding to a refuse pile of empty seashells on a saucer plate. Remaining silent like before, save for her loud chewing. Just another wallflower again. Left without introduction for now. Enyo did all the talking. 

"Please, sit. And order anything you like, it's on our account. Hope the traffic wasn't too bad coming here? Expected you to get stuck on the bridge. Lucky you just missed the roadblock."

He wore his usual robes, pushing an arm swathed in oceanic teal and velvet black gloves. Nothing too distinct from how those who preferred traditional eastern garb, outline-wise. But what detracted most was the outrageously gratuitous amount of skin it revealed down to his abs. There was no real reason for it, other than being showy. 

Spidering his fingers on the menu still left on the table, he slid it over to Xueyi's side.

"You're the..." Enyo trailed off to finally take his cup, he blew gently over the steaming coffee, ice blues side-eyed Xueyi, "One that supplies us those herbal tonics. And those teas, correct?

It was a misstep on his part as well—he should have approached the man from his side, so as not to startle him with the ghostly touch of fingers landing on his shoulder. <strong>"I'm sorry. Were you startled? Hello, 小孩 (little child)."</strong> he inquired with a playful lilt, the amusement evident in his tone as he extended a wave towards the young girl before settling into the seat beside the Ryu. <strong>"And yes, he's described as having long silver hair and blue eyes. There isn't anyone here who matches that description aside from you."</strong> he added, a gentle chuckle punctuating his words.

Observed from the way Enyo whipped his head back prior, Xueyi couldn't help but notice the subtle wince that accompanied the man's movements. It hinted at a discomfort that was not immediately apparent. With a moment of quiet observation, the Nymph assessed Enyo's health from head to toe. There seemed to be no obvious signs of distress in the lower half of his body, suggesting that the source of his discomfort lay elsewhere—perhaps in his neck or the areas above it.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1218899176587526225"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, March 17, 2024 20:30:09 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1218899176587526225">20:30:09</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-12"><strong>"Is there something causing you pain?"</strong> Xueyi inquired, his fingers itching to move, to explore the other's body in search of the source of his discomfort. The bandage wrapped around one of Enyo's horns had caught his attention, stirring a nagging urge to offer his healing touch to alleviate the other's pain. Yet, he knew that consent was paramount—after all, who knew if the Ryu harbored trauma from past experiences of physical contact? <strong>"May I offer my assistance?"</strong> he asked, meeting Enyo's gaze with earnest concern.

As the offer of food was extended, Xueyi shook his head politely, declining with a gentle smile. <strong>"I've already eaten prior to arriving here. Although I wouldn't mind a glass of water."</strong> he replied, sliding the menu to the center of the table, away from both of them. Before he could call for a waiter, however, one approached their table, placing a glass of iced water before him—a standard courtesy, perhaps, extended to all patrons of the gastropub.

<strong>"Ah, thank you."</strong> Xueyi acknowledged with a gracious nod before turning his attention back to Enyo, who had posed a question of his own. <strong>"Indeed, Isawa is a recurring client of mine—I always strive to ensure he's well-stocked. But I must admit, his abrupt departure did raise some questions. He didn't mention anything in his letter to me. If you don't mind me asking, what is the cause of that?"</strong>

Not even a sound of acknowledgement. He let out a quit sigh. It would take some time for this one to open up. And in some wistful way, he felt pity for that. It reminded him of when he was first taken in by the crew, Enyo had been just as closed off as she was. 

Turning back to Xueyi, he chuckled. 

"You'd be surprised. There's a lot more of people who like me on the other islands." 

Enyo paused to take a sip of his coffee. Bitter, just how he liked it. That distracted from the rather, err, <span style="font-style:italic">fertile</span> smell of the environs. Though this part of the river was already miles away from the shore, but the cargo from those passing vessels wafted along the breeze. 

The cup clinked back down on the saucer. 

"My head's killing me, that's what," he confirmed with a slow nod of his head and a smile of discomfort, his other hand pointed at the injured horn, "Broke it in an accident. I can heal, but... it doesn't seem to be healing right. I was rutting when it happened. Isawa didn't tell you about his retirement, did he?" 

How characteristic of the old man to keep the details minimal. Sly dog. Clearly, the former doctor didn't divulge vital information to Xueyi. Otherwise, the other man wouldn't be here. They barely met, yet Enyo was already forming some critical first impression. Xueyi's sweet demeanor sounded genuine, a real concern that was unmarred by jaded cynicism. Completely unlike Isawa, who grew old on lack of empathy. His former shipmate's disposition was one of dry sarcasm whenever an injured sailor stumbled through. He was quicker to treat when an extra tot of rum was promised, not by virtue of a doctor's altruism.

In other words, Enyo was fairly certain that Xueyi didn't dally with criminals. Therefore, he had no idea <span style="font-style:italic">Haraita</span> was controlled by an illicit organization. He had to keep that in mind.

So he started sprinkling in some lies.

"Isawa doesn't have much time left," Enyo allowed his smile to fade away to a practiced, despondent look, lowering his head slightly for a downcast gloom, "He wanted to spend his days with his family. So we let him go. I suppose he heard about my injury. And about the... state of the crew. So he called for you." For dramatic effect, Enyo withheld from elaborating too much, letting his voice thread to a paper-thin whisper, giving the notion of a dire situation.

With the prospect of spending an unknown stretch of time in each other's company, Xueyi was determined to foster goodwill with every member of the crew, wary of the possibility of any unpleasant surprises while he slept soundly in his berth. Despite his best efforts to maintain composure, his gaze involuntarily drifted once more toward the injured horn, his fingers itching to tend to the injury. Clenching his fists to quell the urge to fidget, he turned his attention back to Enyo, awaiting his consent with bated breath.

As Enyo offered a slow nod and a small smile in agreement, a wave of relief washed over Xueyi, alleviating the tension that had coiled within him. <strong>"Please, if you would just lower your head a bit."</strong> he whispered gently, guiding the Ryu to bow his head slightly to afford better access to the injured horn. With careful precision, Xueyi positioned his fingers atop Enyo's head, a silent entreaty for cooperation as he prepared to administer his healing touch. As the peonies blossomed around them, casting a soft pink glow, Xueyi hovered his palms over the injury, channeling the energy of nature to mend the wound. A serene aura enveloped them both as the healing magic took effect, dissolving Enyo's pain and imbuing him with a profound sense of tranquility.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1218962716262400122"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, March 18, 2024 00:42:38 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1218962716262400122">00:42:38</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-16"><strong>"Feeling better?"</strong> Xueyi inquired, his smile warm as he withdrew his hands and settled back into his seat, taking a sip of his iced water. The delicate blooms of peonies lingered in their surroundings, a testament to the healing power that had passed between them. However, the tranquility was momentarily shattered as Enyo dropped a bombshell, catching Xueyi off guard with the unexpected revelation.

<strong>"He... He didn't mention that to me."</strong> Xueyi murmured, his eyes widening in shock at the news, a flicker of hurt shadowing his expression. It was evident that he felt slighted by Isawa's decision to keep his retirement a secret. <strong>"I understand his need for privacy, but.."</strong> his voice trailed off, the unspoken hurt lingering in the air between them.

A brief silence settled over them, heavy with the weight of unspoken words, before Xueyi finally spoke again, his tone tinged with a sense of resignation. <strong>"I wish him all the best in his retirement. I will do my utmost to fulfill his duties, but please forgive me if I fall short of his standard."</strong> he offered, his words tinged with a hint of self-doubt.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1218962753059033089"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/329264780986548224/a_c188ec2a463f8f6d6f40ceee67637020.gif" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: eg0istic.

Both hands folded on the table, he obediently lowered his head. The shifter leant forward, closing the gap when Xueyi’s hand gently guided him. 

He felt the girl stare at him. 

But not because of his horns, she’d gotten used to his appearance throughout their trip. It was rather due to the fact she knew Enyo was wrong. Master Isawa, in fact, was not dying like he implied. She far too naive to grasp that he was lying on purpose. The girl parted her lips to speak. 

She froze when those cold blue eyes, unseen by how Xueyi kept Enyo’s head bowed, moved to meet her stare. His pupils constricted to a predator’s slits. How Enyo managed to steel his gaze like that without moving, was a mystery. But it withheld a silent threat that even a dullard could understand. <span style="font-style:italic">Should she speak now, consequences would come.</span> That was what was relayed to her. Her welfare was held hostage by this man. The <span style="font-style:italic">Haraita</span> was both her savior and captor, just as it had been to Enyo. 

She pretended to hack up a cough, then returned to finish the broth. 

“Have a go at it,” he continued perkily, relaxing from that brief crack in his facade. Enyo lowered his head some more. 

His horns were nothing like any animal’s in shape, form, or color. Each ryū had a distinct appearance to theirs, making it as unique as fingerprints. 

It started out white at the temples, almost the same color as his hair. They have an elegant wave to them, the keratin turning a darker black at the very tips. Where the base met skin, a patchy ring of draconic hide gradiated out. Keeled scales rough enough to cause abrasion if rubbed on. The infected swell on the left side made the scales bulge an angry red. 

But not for long. Enyo closed his eyes as the palliative aura took effect. He breathed out a sigh of relief as the pain subsided. Even the infection’s edematous lump was deflating and drying out. 
<strong> </strong></p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1219169792209063998"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, March 18, 2024 14:25:29 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1219169792209063998">14:25:29</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-19">This magic was working quicker than expected. Isawa had been a decent healer, but that was in combination with extensive pharmacopeia. 

He finally looked up, schooling his face to appear awestruck. 

“Isawa wasn’t joking. You <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> good,” Enyo sat back in his seat. His hands went up to unfurl the bandage around his left horn. Fingers felt for the haircrack cleave in the keratin, but there was none. It was smooth, as if the injury never happened, “I don’t feel the pain anymore… Arcana mages here couldn’t heal as thoroughly as you do.” 

He was exaggerating to flatter. Enyo did feel the residual throb of a fading ache. The licensed mages were more precise. But he couldn’t exactly brush with government healers, now could he? Xueyi was the best option. Eager to help and blissfully ignorant. 

He dropped his hands and looked earnestly back at the aforementioned healer. 

“I understand Isawa promised your stay to last til the next fueling station. But can I persuade you to hang on longer? Just one round trip southwest from the Western Docks. We fish at Felnar’s Reef.” Enyo leant back in his seat and crossed his arms, with one held up to flick a dismissive gesture, “They pay good healers like you a pittance here. I can double that easily. Triple if we catch something valuable, you’d get a cut out of the profit.” He smiled amiably, picking up on Xueyi’s need to be useful in that last remark. So he turned it back against the other man. 

Enyo softened his voice, to make it sound like he was confiding in Xueyi. 

“The boys need a healer like you. Our is… dangerous, to say the least. And I don’t know when I’d get someone willing enough to work out at sea with us. They all seem to want their own clinics or go into private practice.”

His eyes, dark like pools of writing ink, traced the intricate dance of Enyo's form with a calculating gaze. Each carefully woven word, each subtle gesture, was but a fleeting shadow cast upon the canvas of their intertwined destinies. Enyo seemed to harbor hidden intentions, and it would have been impossible to prove had Xueyi not keenly observed the way the girl was silenced with but a mere glare, angled in a way that would have eluded detection had he not paid sufficient attention.

Caught amidst the delicate interplay of light and shadow, Xueyi found himself ensnared in the intricate web of Enyo's deception, yet his spirit remained unyielding against the torrent of deceit. Like a solitary bloom amidst a thicket of thorns, he stood unwavering, his essence untouched by the whispers of falsehood that threatened to engulf him. And as the scene unfolded, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for the girl who, cowed by Enyo's silent threat, dared not speak her truth.

With a piercing gaze that penetrated the veil of illusion, Xueyi glimpsed the true intentions hidden beneath Enyo's facade, his insight a beacon of clarity amidst the murky depths of uncertainty. Though cloaked in the guise of compassion, the shifter's words rang hollow against the backdrop of their shared reality, a discordant melody woven from strands of deception and deceit.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1219251989720858684"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, March 18, 2024 19:52:06 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1219251989720858684">19:52:06</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-21">Yet, within the recesses of his heart, Xueyi harbored a flicker of empathy for those standing behind the man who sought to deceive. Beneath the mask of manipulation, he sensed the echoes of genuine souls seeking assistance in their endeavors, adrift amidst the tumultuous sea of falsehood. And as he listened to Enyo's cajoling words, he couldn't help but shake his head at the misplaced compliments of his healing ability, knowing full well that the powers bestowed upon him were but a shadow of what they could be.

<strong>"For the sake of your solace, safety, and wellbeing, I shall take you up on that offer."</strong> Xueyi spoke, his voice a gentle whisper that stirred the silence of the night. With a graceful gesture, he extended his hand in silent solidarity, a beacon of hope amidst the looming shadows of uncertainty. <strong>"However, I will only stay for as long as we decided. After that, you will have to send me home. My responsibilities still lie in Emerald Isle, after all."</strong>

His resolve remained firm, making it clear that his presence would be temporary, tethered to the agreed-upon duration of their journey. <strong>"Therefore, you shouldn't become too comfortable with having me as a healer. You will need to find a replacement once I depart. I won't extend my stay on this ship, and what comes after I leave will no longer concern me."</strong> The Nymph's voice held a tone of determination, signaling his unwillingness to be taken advantage of, especially by someone he had come to realize was manipulative through his easy-going and thoughtful facade.

Of course, Xueyi wasn't entirely devoid of empathy. He understood the potential risks of leaving a vacancy behind, leaving the crew vulnerable to unforeseen dangers. But such concerns need not burden his companions; they were his own to bear.

This was going smoothly. He didn't think Xueyi would agree so readily. He hadn't the foggiest idea that they caught on as well, that Xueyi was also playing into his biases. Particularly, the bias that assumed all these Emerald country bumpkins knew little of the world outside their quaint little forest homes. 

"I suppose you two should be introduced then. Tomoe? This is Chu Xueyi, you'll be assisting him with whatever he needs help with. Just like we agreed with the cook, yes?" 

An errand girl, basically. Her duties were mainly to tend to Xueyi, from grinding up herbs, distilling elixirs, to more menial tasks like cleaning his office or a messy operation. 

"Mm..." the girl replied with nothing more than a noise with her mouth full.

<span style="font-style:italic">"Say that again?"</span>

She picked up on that testy voice coming from Enyo as stringent disapproval. For a shady guy, he was uptight about rank. But Tomoe had no intention of rebellion. She swallowed her last morsel. Tomoe finally afforded the direct eye contact due to Xueyi, pulling her greasy hands off the table, and bowing her head. "H-Hello, Chu-san," she stammered in a barely audible voice. 

Enyo smiled as he leisurely took up on his coffee again. He turned back to Xueyi. 

"Her room's next to your office. So she'll be in your care. I reckon Isawa never told you about me in detail? If you need anything, anything at all," Enyo gave a cursory look down, gauging how much luggage Xueyi brought with them, "You can approach me directly. Or have Tomoe do it, she's got the lay of the ship by now." 

What Xueyi brought might not be enough, given their change of plans. The trip to the first fueling station would only take a month. While the journey Xueyi agreed to would take several.

He noted the ease with which Enyo orchestrated their conversation, a master manipulator pulling the strings of their interaction with deft precision. It was a skill Xueyi himself was familiar with, having traversed the intricate web of social dynamics with practiced finesse.

As Tomoe was introduced, Xueyi's attention shifted to the girl, his eyes a reflection of the depths of his soul as he observed her with quiet contemplation. There was a silent strength in her demeanor, a resilience that belied her outward timidity, like a delicate flower weathering the storm. <strong>"你好 ||Hello||. It's nice to meet you, Tomoe."</strong> Xueyi murmured softly, offering a reassuring smile to the runt. But beneath the veneer of civility, the Nymph couldn't help but feel a pang of unease at the subtle undercurrents of power dynamics at play. He noticed the way Enyo's words carried a faint hint of coercion as he spoke to the girl, a veiled threat masked by false geniality. His gaze flickered momentarily with a subtle side-eye towards Enyo, a silent rebuke for his indirect intimidation of Tomoe.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1219669712779346093"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Tuesday, March 19, 2024 23:31:59 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1219669712779346093">23:31:59</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-24">Turning back to Enyo, Xueyi's expression remained composed, betraying none of the tumultuous thoughts that churned beneath the surface. <strong>"I appreciate your hospitality. Thank you, Enyo, I shall keep that in mind."</strong> he spoke with measured grace, his words a testament to the depth of his understanding. Yet, behind his polite facade, Xueyi resolved to keep a watchful eye on Tomoe, ensuring that she was treated with the respect and dignity she deserved.

As the girl savored the last morsel of her meal, the timbre of a crew member's voice cut through the air, echoing across the wooden deck like a harbinger of departure. The call to action rippled through the ship, stirring a sense of urgency in the stillness of the moment. Xueyi regarded the summons as an unspoken cue for their imminent journey's commencement, and with a graceful nod of his head, he looked towards Enyo and Tomoe, waiting for them to rise from their seats and aboard the ship, and towards the adventure that awaited them beyond the confines of the ship's hull.

As they stood poised on the threshold between past and future, the crew member, Genji, approached Enyo with deference, his demeanor a testament to the hierarchy that governed life aboard the vessel. With a respectful bow, he extended warm greetings to Enyo, his attempt at camaraderie laced with a hint of deference. Yet, beneath the veneer of formality, there lingered an unspoken tension—a subtle dance of power and authority, played out in the exchange of pleasantries.

That's what I'm meant to do," he assured gladly. While this was all down to brass tacks, Enyo did look forward to another young, able-bodied professional aboard the ship. One that wasn't one of their wearied sailors or the whores kept onboard for transport to different isles. It meant a peer at the officer's table, for once. Recently, Enyo was the lone, young face amongst them. 

When he heard a beckon from one of the crew, he knew it was time to leave. Enyo stared in the distance again, at the bridge where protesters swelled the lanes. Chorus of shouts were strewn across the air, as the leaders of the riot committees scrambled atop makeshift platforms, hollering protest slogans. These were Xenians, mostly. Though there were a few human groups interspersed in their numbers. 

Vodyanoi were leaping out of the riversides with perfectly-shaped spheres of water, rolling between webbed hands. Where those were tossed, the surface tension didn't break. It didn't flatten out to rejoin the river's nebulous mixture. A ridge of water was beginning to form before the bridge. It was as if they were rolling clay, stacking it one atop the other. Vodyanoi were expert watercræfters. They made capable stevedores and dockworkers for that. And it seemed they'd gotten sick of their paltry wages.

Enyo stood up, he called back out to Genji. 

"They're gouging the river, aren't they?" he said without taking his eyes off the developing spectacle. 

His guess was confirmed upon seeing some of the ships, which intended to pass the river, being turned away. Frog heads bobbed out of the water, their voices a strained croak as they yelled for ships to stop. More resurfaced to dissuade vessels from simply swerving to the side. They were forming a link of bodies, holding webbed hands together, keeping the watercræfters protected behind them as they carved a channel out of the river.

Every hour of no shipment was money lost. 

Trouble, was what it meant.

"Change of plans, Mister Chu. I intended to make a stop by the Floating Markets. I suppose we'll have to resupply elsewhere." 

Coins clinked as Enyo took a few out of his pocket, depositing their payment on the table. And perhaps a little extra for their regular's loyalty. 

"Wouldn't want to get caught up with the authorities." 

Tomoe stood up abruptly. There was no time for dessert. She could tell by Enyo's tone that lingering would be a bad idea, but before she could rush to take Xueyi's luggage, Enyo raised a gloved hand, and then flicked it towards their awaiting boat. She stopped at the simple gesture, turned around, and dashed to it. Tomoe whizzed by Genji, her straw-slippered feet thudded on the boarding stairs. She took two at a time. Whatever it was she was running from here, she was eager to leave. 

The initiative was appreciated, but Enyo would rather Tomoe <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> hold anything with her greasy hands yet. So he swept down and took Xueyi's luggage himself. There was one more too, a maroon carpet bag he'd kept under the table until now. 

"Genj!" was his forewarning for his crewmate to catch it, before tossing the heavy carpet bag over to Genji, "Take it to my office when we arrive. *Do not open it.*" The stern look added an implied, *I'll know if you do," to it.

And with that, he glanced down at Xueyi and nodded. "Let's move," he said, leaving the table with the new healer's luggage in tow. The jet black of his robs fluttered behind him. He strode towards their small ship with heavy, booted footsteps.

Yet, caution tethered his trust, a lingering shadow cast by the manipulative dance that had unfolded before. Nevertheless, he acknowledged Enyo's words with a gentle nod, a grateful curve touching the corners of his lips as he raised his gaze to meet the shifter's.

Surveying the motley crew assembled to embark upon their maritime voyage, Xueyi noted with a pang the predominance of weathered faces, seasoned by time and tides. While their seasoned wisdom could promise safety amidst the swells, he couldn't shake the apprehension of feeling adrift among them, an outsider in their seafaring fraternity, struggling to find his place amid the ebb and flow of their seasoned camaraderie.

As Enyo orchestrated the departure with deft precision, Xueyi couldn't help but sense the rising tension swirling around them, a storm brewing beneath the surface of apparent calm. Amidst the tumult of protests and unforeseen disruptions, he maintained a veneer of composure, his gaze flitting between the unfolding drama and the eager anticipation radiating from the young Tomoe, her eyes alight with the promise of adventure beyond the horizon.

Following Enyo's steady gaze, Xueyi's own drifted seaward, only to recoil at the sight of the Vodyanois, their menacing presence looming like specters upon the water's edge. These creatures, with their grotesque visages, stood as a stark juxtaposition to the gentle denizens of the forest he had grown to love. Though his heart harbored a fondness for all living beings, he couldn't suppress a shudder at the sight of these aquatic monstrosities, their unsettling proximity to the vessel serving as a disconcerting omen of trials yet to come.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1220417166839648336"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, March 22, 2024 01:02:06 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1220417166839648336">01:02:06</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-28"><strong>"Very well."</strong> Xueyi acquiesced to Enyo's amended plans, a nod of reluctant acceptance punctuating his reply. Though he harbored a penchant for adherence to established protocols, he recognized the necessity of adaptability in the face of unforeseen challenges. Enyo's decisive actions spoke of a pragmatism honed by experience, a trait worthy of begrudging respect.

As he moved to retrieve his belongings, Xueyi found his efforts preempted by Enyo's gesture of assistance, leaving him momentarily stunned by the unexpected display of kindness. Suppressing the impulse to protest, he offered a gracious acknowledgment instead, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips. <strong>"Thank you, you didn't have to."</strong>

Genji, though taken aback, managed to catch the carpet bag in his arms, albeit with some difficulty maintaining his balance. It seemed the weight of the bag had caught him off guard. "Yes, sir," he stammered, his nod accompanied by a visible gulp of apprehension, before swiftly scurrying off to Enyo's office with hurried steps.

Xueyi found himself disquieted by Enyo's approach to handling matters. Why did Enyo rush to threats, whether spoken or unspoken, when negotiations were underway? He released a soft sigh, contemplating the thought. Perhaps, once he had adjusted to his new life, he would feel compelled to express his concerns to Enyo. However, for the time being, he recognized the importance of receiving guidance from him, and thus resolved to tread cautiously to avoid invoking his ire.

As they crossed the threshold into the ship's sanctum, Xueyi's senses were assailed by a cacophony of sights and sounds, each offering a tantalizing glimpse into the bustling heart of maritime commerce. From the creaking timbers of the deck beneath his feet to the salty tang of the ocean breeze, every sensation served as a testament to the boundless expanse of possibilities awaiting them on their voyage into the unknown.

Gentle, bobbing river current translated to every tip and sway of the boat. But that was just a taste of what was to come in the future. 

The ship’s boat was alight with merriment. It emitted a strong, hazy yellow glow from the numerous lanterns powering the ship. 

At the very center of the vessel, a squat, pagoda-like structure was thrust out to the sky. The balconies had tiny figures sprinting in the background. Likely more crewmen organizing supplies and other smaller paraphernalia like Genji. 

At the very first floor, out came a crew member who shouted his lungs out, rallying the others to move faster. Like Enyo, he was distinguishable by what he wore. Where the rest of the sailors had no set uniform and wore whatever was available to them, it was obvious by their damp shirts and faded trousers that they were lower on the ranks. The officer who came out was dressed in a fresh, green overcoat. 

Despite its smaller size, activity buzzed in a flurry. Sailors were still porting the casks of wine, rum, and ale to one side, stacking them in order. A net was thrown over the liquor stash, and quickly tied to keep it in place. Right across this, a few other sailors were tamping down thick canvas over a lump of burlap bags. A confluence of scent wafted before being suffocated by the canvas covering. Cinnamon, cloves, from thickly saccharine to aromatic. Spices for trading — typical fare for a merchant vessel.

Crewmates splintered into organized groups, half of them were preparing to pulling and folding the ladder onto the deck, and hoisting yards of ropes back up. The other half were men and women stationing themselves to a pair of wooden instruments located on the edges of both port and starboard, positioned perpendicular to each other across the ship. These were winches, shaped like waterwheels. Sailors grabbed a length of rope which was much thicker on said winches, and lined up. A bellow was sounded to keep them moving in sync, as they dug their heels in and pulled. Intermittent shouts of counting ensured they worked like a well-oiled machine. 

“C’mere,” Enyo had to raise his voice above the din, almost competing with the orchestra of noise around them, hollering for the nymph’s attention, “We’ll go around.” 

Enyo had something to show Xueyi. 

Instead of leading them to the bow, he was taking him stern-side. *The back of the ship*, instead of the front. 

He transferred the luggage to his other hand. Half-turned, the dragonshifter held out an outstretched arm, using his free hand to usher Xueyi in by the shoulders. This smacked the other man straight to his side, allowing his larger frame to act as a point of stability. He had to do so, because the ship suddenly juddered violently. “Woah-oh there,” he jested lightly, “There it goes.”  Enyo’s boots spaced out, keeping him planted firmly. His timing was precise, he’d clearly done this to the point of routine. Enyo knew exactly when the <span style="font-style:italic">beast</span> piloting this ship was rearing itself up for movement.

While the swaying wasn't enough to send him tumbling, it certainly challenged his balance, a reminder of his novice status aboard the vessel. His every step was a cautious dance, a delicate balance between finding his sea legs and the fear of an unexpected stumble.

Yet, despite his initial unease, the sight of the ship's workings in action filled him with a sense of wonder and admiration. The items scattered across the deck, once mere glimpses on the docks or within the pages of storybooks, now stood before him in all their tangible glory. The rhythmic creaking of the timbers beneath his feet seemed to echo like a heartbeat, grounding him in the realization that he was now a part of something far greater than himself. It was as if the very soul of the ship resonated with the ancient pulse of the ocean, inviting him to join in its timeless dance.

The air hummed with the symphony of the sea—a chorus of waves against the hull, the calls of gulls overhead, and the distant hum of the ship's engines. It was an orchestra of sensations unlike anything he had ever experienced, stirring a potent mix of fear and excitement within him. Each breath he took seemed to carry with it the salty tang of adventure, filling his lungs with the promise of endless possibilities on the horizon.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1221228804194701345"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, March 24, 2024 06:47:16 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1221228804194701345">06:47:16</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-32">As he stood transfixed by the coordinated movements of the crew, he marveled at their effortless grace and precision. Each sailor seemed to move with a practiced ease, their weathered faces illuminated by the soft glow of lantern light. He watched in awe as they hoisted sails and transported cargo with a fluidity that spoke volumes of their expertise. It was a symphony of motion, a testament to the timeless artistry of seafaring that had been honed through years of tradition and practice.

Suddenly, Enyo's voice broke through his reverie, drawing his attention back to the present moment. With a nod of understanding, Xueyi followed the Ryu, his curiosity piqued by the unexpected direction they were taking. Despite his confusion, he trusted that Enyo had something intriguing in store, his heart pounding with anticipation at the prospect of what lay ahead.

However, what caught Xueyi off guard was the sudden, forceful pull that yanked him to Enyo's side, especially given the ship's abrupt judder. It was a less-than-gentle maneuver, exacerbated by the unpredictable sway of the vessel. Despite his initial surprise, Xueyi quickly regained his composure, smoothly extricating himself while clearing his throat.

<strong>"Thank you,"</strong> he breathed, his voice carrying a hint of gratitude. His hand lingered on Enyo's clothing, a subconscious reflex to steady himself should the ship sway violently once more. In that fleeting moment, amidst the tumultuous dance of the ocean, Xueyi found himself grateful for Enyo's unexpected support, even as he braced himself for whatever surprises lay ahead on their journey.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1221228844560941098"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/329264780986548224/a_c188ec2a463f8f6d6f40ceee67637020.gif" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: eg0istic.

His hand fella way from the nymph. But the latter seemed to latch onto him still, with those fingers bunching up his sleeve. Enyo's lips twitched a cursory smile. 

"You'll get used to it," he drawled. 

He raised his arm up slightly, prying off Xueyi's hand, only to audaciously wrap them fully around his bicep, as though he were formally escorting someone.

Onward they went again. Enyo led them around the main edifice. When the stern came into view, more people were in the area. A different, <span style="font-style:italic">perfumed</span> crowd, however. Omegas mostly, judging from the thick, cloying scent they amassed. Instead of the rough-hewn sailors buzzing around the main deck, these were gents and ladies swathed in rich finery. Beaded skirts and gossamer silks. Their hair were either done up in elaborate styles, or otherwise left to cascade for those whose tresses had shimmery luster. Even the men had long hair. Melodious laughter tinkled in tune to the delicate chime of their <span style="font-style:italic">kanzashi</span> ornaments. 

Pallid faces were covered with the artifice of beauty. Flushed with lipstick, smattered in powdery foundation. They sat on round tables. Many drank from a store of wine jars being passed around. Some were shrieking over games they played to pass the time. Dainty hands would scrabble at mahjong tiles, or flick hand-painted karuta cards down.

"Enyooooo!" a querulous voice hollered. 

It was followed by a chorus of harpy shrieks, as each of their friends noticed the bursar and their new addition to the crew. 

But of course, they had no idea Xueyi was to be the ship's doctor. 

"Yoohoo!"

"Come here!"

"Hey! *Pretty boy*!"

That <span style="font-style:italic">boy</span> was a pointed catcall at Xueyi. Inchoate rumblings of jealousy. 

Should he ever pay it heed, or so much as glimpsed, he'd see an odious sight. The mouths that laughed and jeered shown teeth painted pitch black. <span style="font-style:italic">Ohaguro</span> was still practiced by their more traditional oiran.

He raised a hand in greeting, but nothing more. Though one of them was not a threat, they were rather overwhelming when banded together in groups. 

He was leading the nymph to the very edge, where the railings were. In an effort to put them out of his mind, Enyo whispered a strange question to Xueyi. 

"You ever rode a ship that's alive?" 

Coincidentally, Tomoe was there, with her back to them. She gripped tight on the rails and raised herself up her tiptoes. Whatever she was staring at down below, it caught her in total fascination.

It was a subtle reminder of the intricate dance of social conventions and the ever-present specter of misunderstanding. Despite harboring his own inklings about Enyo's preferences, Xueyi understood the necessity for discretion, particularly in the close confines of the ship. With a nod of silent acknowledgment, he was about to pull away, only for his hand to be placed upon the Ryu's bicep. Though surprised, the Nymph presumed that it was only for a better hold- in case the ship was to sway once again.

As they resumed their path, Xueyi found himself once more ensnared by the allure of their surroundings. This time, his gaze lingered not on the industrious activities of the crew but on a different scene altogether—a gathering of individuals bedecked in opulent attire, their very presence a stark juxtaposition to the practical garb of the sailors. These were the elite, the privileged few who traversed the seas in pursuit of pleasure or business, their extravagant ensembles a testament to their elevated status and substantial wealth.

The mingling of scents assaulted Xueyi's senses with a heady intensity, a potent concoction of natural musk and overpowering perfumes that threatened to overwhelm him. His sensitive nose twitched involuntarily, a reflexive response to the onslaught of fragrance that surrounded him. While he understood the necessity for such indulgence, particularly within certain social circles, he couldn't help but feel a pang of discomfort at the excessiveness of it all, a stark reminder of the stark disparities that existed within the world.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1221529351762350223"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, March 25, 2024 02:41:32 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1221529351762350223">02:41:32</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-37">Redirecting his attention back to Enyo, Xueyi found himself pondering the Ryu's intentions with a curious intensity, his thoughts drifting like ships adrift upon the uncertain sea. However, before he could delve deeper into speculation, a prickly voice sliced through the air, calling out Enyo's name with an unmistakable edge of familiarity. Xueyi followed the sound with a mixture of apprehension and intrigue, only to find it emanating from the peculiar gathering of elites.

A fleeting moment of discomfort washed over him as he caught sight of their blackened teeth, a cultural practice that stirred distant memories of his own lineage. Yet, he offered a polite smile before tactfully redirecting his gaze, grateful when Enyo began to lead them away from the group, like a captain guiding his ship away from treacherous waters.

As they reached the very edge of the ship, came an unexpected question from the bursar.  Xueyi furrowed his brows in thoughtful contemplation, his mind a tempest of introspection amidst the calm sea of conversation. <strong>"Alive?"</strong> he echoed, his tone laced with a hint of curiosity. After a beat of reflection, he shook his head in negation. <strong>"I haven't been on a ship at all."</strong> The Nymph answered, his gaze shifting to Tomoe.

Concern blossomed within him as he observed her precarious position, her diminutive form precariously balanced on the ship's edge. He pulled away from Enyo carefully, pulling her back from the brink with a gentle tug, mindful of the potential danger that lurked beneath the surface. <strong>"It's dangerous for you to lean so much, Tomoe. You might fall should there be a violent sway."</strong> he murmured softly, his touch imbued with a tender reassurance that mirrored the gentle lapping of waves against the hull.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1221534497082704004"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/329264780986548224/a_c188ec2a463f8f6d6f40ceee67637020.gif" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: eg0istic.

He smiled for a second, that was all. The healer would be in for quite a shock once he realized how hard life at sea was. So he kept mum, just in case they might get cold feet about the whole affair. 

But as far as he was concerned, this day was full of shallow first impressions. Xueyi needn't be aware of the true face of his situation just yet. That would reveal itself over time, thousands of leagues across the sea, when that oceanic isolation would make it nigh impossible to escape. 

As they left the louche congregation behind them, Enyo looked on in curiosity as Xueyi pulled themselves away. He stalked right behind the nymph. 

"He's right you know, one tip and you'd fall right over." 

Tomoe glanced back at them, with an unreadable expression. She slid back down a little from her toes, so her upper body wasn't projecting so far out the railing. Not at a dangerous angle, but Tomoe stubbornly wriggled out of Xueyi's grip, and continued to peer down into the river. She was still a child, after all. 

Enyo dropped the baggage by their feet. Approaching the railing, he laid a hand on Xueyi's shoulder and leaned in to murmur. "I trust you'll keep an eye on her?" he paused to glance over his shoulder - at the garishly lit tables, where tawdry robes and shrieks of laughter echoed from Haraita's whores, courtesan and streetwalker alike - "Don't let her near them. Understand?"

For all his minatory against Tomoe, the divorce altered something within his conscience. Enyo had none to look out for him when he was younger, not counting his mentors who were more superiors than pseudo-parental figures. He didn't care that he had none ever since he'd left home. But he couldn't look at another child onboard without thinking about his unborn one. His normally tepid amorality was being skewed this way and that. 

Slipping away from Xueyi, he peered over the railing too. 

"You'll see what I meant by alive." 

In the land with no sun, the water was pitch black past a meter or so. It reflected the lights from their small cargo schooner, as well as the port from around it. But it couldn't filter deep enough to reveal what was hiding under the keel. 

At first there came shouting from the distance. The sailors were hoisting up the sails. Behind them, shadows of wooden masts stretched. Not upwards, but *sideways*. It unfolded out of the sides of the hull, poking out like the spines of a lionfish. If Xueyi were to look back, he'd see a few of the crew nimbly run along the perilous spokes, which tapered at the end. Those of avian heritage were picked for the job, as their taloned feet gripped far better. They affixed the sails on the lateen rigs. A deep maroon winged the ship on both sides.

The deck creaked underneath their feet, heralding a weaker quake than before. Then it subdued as the first one did. Only, there was no stop to the subtle movement of rise and fall. A sailor certainly ignore it after a while, as it synced to the bobbing waters. But to those inexperienced, one merely had to stand still to feel that odd sensation, that the ship wasn't stationary in different way than being moored to a port. A loud, hydraulic hiss echoed from bow to stern. Like its mothership, the schooner wasn't all made of wood. There were parts that powered by steam and, <span style="font-style:italic">something else.</span>

Or perhaps it was a trick of hearing. The emission of equipment burring, hull creaking, and hidden instruments wheezing in hidden galleys... agglutinated together, it sounded like a the ship <span style="font-style:italic">sighed</span> collectively. 

Its unseen wooden frames heaved inconspicuously, like an expanding ribcage. 

It was breathing.

Something dark finally came up to view, where the light just barely illuminated the first meter of depth. When it finally broke the surface, a mass of vivid scarlet came through. A tentacle spanning  a diameter several times that of the thin lionfish spars strutting out from the ship. A light spray of water tickled their faces. Its sheer heft was palpable by how inexorably <span style="font-style:italic">slow</span> it moved.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1222075950590590976"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/469718795393433610/31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6.jpeg" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: zephtre

The brief smile that graced the Ryu's lips seemed to hold a hint of knowing, a silent acknowledgment of the challenges that lay ahead. Despite the lack of verbal reassurance, Xueyi couldn't help but feel a ripple of apprehension at the thought of what awaited him on this unfamiliar journey.

As they distanced themselves from the enigmatic gathering of elites, Xueyi found himself trailing behind Enyo, his steps mirroring the Ryu's with a quiet determination. He couldn't shake off the lingering unease that lingered in the air, a palpable tension that seemed to coil around them like an invisible serpent.

<strong>"He's right, you know,"</strong> Enyo's voice cut through the silence, drawing Xueyi's attention back to the present moment. The concern in his tone was palpable as he spoke of the precariousness of their surroundings. Xueyi glanced back at Tomoe, noting her stubborn insistence on exploring the world around her, even in the face of potential danger. Despite his best efforts to protect her, he couldn't help but feel a pang of worry for the young girl, her innocence a stark contrast to the harsh realities of their environment.

As Enyo dropped his baggage by their feet, Xueyi felt the weight of his responsibility settle upon his shoulders like a heavy cloak. The Ryu's hand on his shoulder was a grounding presence amidst the swirling chaos, his whispered words a solemn reminder of the dangers that lurked beneath the surface. Xueyi nodded in silent agreement, his gaze lingering on the garishly lit tables where shadows danced and laughter rang out like a siren's call, then, the little girl in which his responsibilities lied on.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1222249341788360744"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Wednesday, March 27, 2024 02:22:31 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1222249341788360744">02:22:31</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-44">[+]

He wasn't exactly sure why he needed to shield the girl away from those people- to the point where even a simple interaction would not be allowed by the way Enyo phrased it. Perhaps it was because nobles and elites were known to have a certain liking towards children. Xueyi found his lips curved downwards in a frown at that, his hands turning into fists at the mere thought of it. Disgusting. How people like that still walk around the Earth after imprisonment freely to this day never ceased to baffle him. How are they not deemed a danger to society anymore just because they served a certain duration in a prison cell?

Death is the only correct punishment in Xueyi's mind.

There was a heaviness in Enyo's demeanor that Xueyi couldn't ignore, a haunted look in his eyes that spoke volumes of the burdens he carried. It was a stark reminder of the fragility of life aboard the ship, a delicate balance between survival and succumbing to the darkness that lurked within. It seemed that he, too, cared about this child, for all his stoicism. There was a flicker of humanity in Enyo's gaze, a glimmer of compassion that spoke volumes of the man beneath the hardened exterior.

Maybe he wasn't as bad as he initially thought.

As Enyo slipped away to peer over the railing, Xueyi joined him, his senses attuned to the subtle shifts of the oceanic landscape. The sight of the pitch-black waters beneath them sent a shiver down his spine, a stark reminder of the vast unknown that stretched out before them. All his life, he'd only ever known the lush greens of the forest, the gentle melodies of birdsong at dawn, and the rhythmic chirping of crickets as they sought refuge beneath bushes. The ocean, however, was an entirely different realm—a realm of uncharted waters and boundless mysteries waiting to be unraveled.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1222249433086038086"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Wednesday, March 27, 2024 02:22:53 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1222249433086038086">02:22:53</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-45">[+]

The inky depths of the sea churned with untold secrets, their murky depths concealing wonders and terrors alike. As Xueyi gazed into the abyss below, he couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation gnawing at his insides, a primal fear of the unknown that settled uncomfortably in his gut. The vast expanse of water seemed to stretch on endlessly, its dark depths holding secrets that no mortal eye had ever beheld.

Then, as if summoned by the depths themselves, a massive tentacle breached the surface, its scarlet hue a stark contrast to the darkness below. Xueyi felt a surge of primal fear course through him, his heart pounding in his chest as he beheld the sheer magnitude of the creature before them.

His eyes remained glued to the appendage as his instincts told him to *flee*, finally looking away once he heard the loud voices coming from the ship crew members. Tomoe. *Tomoe*.

He knew for a fact that Enyo would be able to handle himself, but the girl.. Without a moment's hesitation, he swept Tomoe into his arms, a silent vow of protection etched upon his soul. As he whisked her away to safety, a sense of urgency fueled his movements, a desperate plea for sanctuary amidst the chaos. Settling her into a crate that is big enough to fit an adult of an isolated cabin, Xueyi whispered words of reassurance, a gentle promise of return lingering in the air like a sacred vow. She nodded with fearful eyes, and with a tender pat on her head, he closed the crate with a soft click, his heart heavy with the weight of responsibility.

With a sense of duty weighing heavily upon him, Xueyi swiftly departed from the shelter, keenly aware of the crew members who would inevitably require his healing skills. Racing back to the ship's edge, his eyes scanned the tumultuous sea with frantic intensity, desperately searching for any sign of Enyo amidst the chaos. <strong>"Enyo!"</strong> he cried out, his voice tinged with urgency, its echoes reverberating across the turbulent waters.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1222249459975585792"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/329264780986548224/a_c188ec2a463f8f6d6f40ceee67637020.gif" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: eg0istic.

Thus, his eyes naturally sought the reaction of those who hadn’t. But when his gaze flicked over to Xueyi, he was startled to see the other man bolt into action. With a yelp from Tomoe, the new doctor essentially plucked her off like a stray kitten. She thrashed with all her might, but her starved frame hadn’t quite imbibed the last few days of sudden nourishment yet.

The dragonshifter peeled halfway from the railing, but still kept his hand on it. His gaze followed Xueyi’s panicked movements, smiling in amusement. 

Next to Tomoe’s crate, the nearest onlookers were streetwalkers in less luxuriant layers than their courtesan counterparts. Their game was interrupted by the flurry Xueyi kicked up near them. Chimes of raucous giggling echoed after the new doctor rushed back to the railing. One of them knocked on the crate, and peeked in at the confused Tomoe inside. 

When Xueyi returned to where he was, Enyo snorted.

“What are you shouting my name for? I’m right here,” his voice quavered, before finally letting go to laugh with a shaking head, “That’s just the ship waking. Won't kill ya. You’ll see more of them when we reach Western Dock.” 

 More of them. There were other ships just like this one. Half inorganic material, and half <span style="font-style:italic">something else</span> that was quite clearly alive. Or atleast, not inanimate.

Though he had no doubt Xueyi was probably bursting with questions. It wouldn’t be good to have their doctor panicking aboard the main vessel. Luckily, Enyo was patient enough to entertain it. Xueyi was fortunate his guide was him. The bursar was much more considerate than the other officers, most of which were either too sarcastic or ill-tempered to help fresh recruits gain sea legs. Especially ones who’d never seen vessels like these before. This was routine to them. Mundane. For one, what Xueyi stood on was just one of Haraita’s ships tenders, used for resupply or intercepting — yes, this entire boat, pagoda and all, could fit inside Haraita’s underbelly. That told of the sheer breadth and magnitude of Enyo’s mothership. Perhaps by seeing the workings of Haraita’s exposed keel, he could better illustrate it to his new colleague. 

A loud crash resounded, and a refreshing spray of river-water pelted them. Enyo squinted his eyes. Both his hair and his robes billowed from the slight gust. It damped their clothes. But for some reason, fate decided to add an extra helping of not-so-misted water splattering on Xueyi’s head. 

“Relax. Why don’t you?” Enyo smiled, his laughter settled down to muted chuckling. He good-naturedly smacked a hand on Xueyi’s back, “The real work doesn’t start until I settle you in your office. Which by the way, won’t be for an hour. Takes half to get to the port.”

From the churning river, several tentacles burst forth of equal, gargantuan size. The huge tendrils cast stretching shadows over the aft-deck. Then they swayed apart in roughly equal number, like the parting of a curtain. Suction sides flattened and curled as they plunged back into the depths, almost like a swimmer’s strokes underwater.

But every once in a while, if one squinted hard enough, the hazy red of those tentacles could be discerned if they moved within a meter from the surface. Even that close to light, it was still a hazy outline of red, swirling underneath moonlit ripples.

The boat lurched forward (from the pair’s perspective, atleast) with its first movement. A klaxon sounded above them, announcing the beginning of departure. They were heading downriver now, sluicing through at a steady pace. Other cargo ships passed them. 

Enyo bent down to grab the baggage handle again. A gloved hand beckoned for the doctor to follow. He turned, carrying Xueyi’s stuff. 

“Let’s head in. We can sit there. Isawa-san left a few of his tools behind, I ought to hand them to you.”</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1223338437793546280"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/469718795393433610/31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6.jpeg" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: zephtre

His mind raced with questions, each one intertwining with a thread of uncertainty, creating a tapestry of bewilderment that left him feeling adrift in a sea of confusion. Was his reaction justified, or had he allowed his imagination to run rampant with fear? Contemplating this, a flush of warmth suffused his cheeks, a telltale sign of embarrassment creeping into his demeanour like tendrils of creeping ivy.

As he stood there, caught in the throes of his own internal turmoil, Xueyi couldn't help but cringe at the memory of hastily sheltering the young girl in a crate. The image of her bewildered expression lingered in his mind, a silent testament to his own folly. Why had he acted so rashly? Was this truly a common occurrence on the ship, or had he allowed his own fears to cloud his judgment? These questions tugged at the corners of his mind, each one a weighty reminder of his own vulnerability in the face of the unknown. He buried his face in his hands, seeking solace in the darkness that enveloped him, yet finding none.

A soft sigh escaped him as he lowered his hands, slowly making his way towards the Ryu. His brow furrowed with consternation as he met Enyo's amused gaze. <strong>"You should have warned me,"</strong> he chided softly, his tone laced with a mixture of reproach and resignation. He offered a gentle swat at the Alpha's arm, a feeble attempt to mask his own discomfort in the face of his own embarrassment. The realization that he had become the probability of being the unwitting subject of ridicule by the other crewmates gnawed at him, a bitter taste lingering on his tongue like the remnants of a half-forgotten dream.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1223731199994892308"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, March 31, 2024 04:30:53 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1223731199994892308">04:30:53</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-52">[+]

The revelation that such occurrences were commonplace on the ship only deepened Xueyi's sense of incredulity. <strong>"This—"</strong> he began, gesturing to the ship beneath his feet, <strong>"is considered normal?"</strong> His voice wavered with disbelief, his raised eyebrows betraying his astonishment. He sighed heavily, shoulders slumping with the weight of newfound knowledge. <strong>"You ought to have told me what to expect before we embarked,"</strong> he muttered, his gaze averted to avoid Enyo's probing gaze. The words hung in the air like a heavy fog, suffusing the space between them with an unspoken tension.

A sudden splash of river-water jolted Xueyi from his reverie, prompting a startled yelp as droplets cascaded over his head. He grimaced, fingers gingerly probing the damp strands of his hair. Before he even recovered, an abrupt smack to his back surprised him. Knowing Enyo's gesture was well-intentioned, it elicited a small chuckle from Xueyi, a glimmer of amusement breaking through the veil of embarrassment that still shrouded him. <strong>"Thank you for letting me know,"</strong> he murmured, a faint smile playing at his lips as he finally began to relax in the Ryu's presence.

However, his moment of respite was short-lived as more tentacles emerged from the depths, their presence eliciting a reflexive jump from Xueyi. Though he no longer panicked as before, the sight still filled him with a sense of shock and awe. How fascinating it was to witness the ship's intricate mechanisms in action, to behold the symbiotic relationship between biology and machine. As Enyo beckoned him forward, Xueyi tore his gaze away from the tentacles, his mind buzzing with curiosity and anticipation.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1223731487585599608"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, March 31, 2024 04:32:02 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1223731487585599608">04:32:02</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-53">[+]

As they when on their way inside, Xueyi's thoughts turned to Tomoe, the young girl he had hastily sheltered in a crate. <strong>"Wait,"</strong> he interjected, pulling on Enyo's sleeve before releasing it with a hesitant gesture. <strong>"Tomoe. I need to get her out of the crate I put her in,"</strong> he explained, his voice tinged with lingering embarrassment. Though he dreaded facing her after his earlier display of panic, he couldn't bear the thought of leaving her alone. If Enyo laughed once again, he only looked away, the warmth returning to his cheeks.

<strong>"You can go ahead first,"</strong> Xueyi uttered awkwardly, his gaze darting everywhere but Enyo's eyes. <strong>"I'll come to you later. With her."</strong> With a slight shift of his weight, he began to retreat to the spot where he had left Tomoe, his footsteps echoing softly against the deck. The raucous laughter and mocking jeers of the streetwalkers washed over him like a relentless tide, but he refused to let their words pierce his resolve. He had no desire to engage in futile defences or explanations; after all, it was his own folly that had led to this embarrassing situation.

With a sense of reluctance, Xueyi made his way to where he had left Tomoe, his ears deafened by the laughter of and m streetwalkers nearby. He opened the crate and helped her out, offering her a reassuring smile despite the lingering sense of shame that weighed upon him. <strong>"I apologize. I was.. admittedly, panicking earlier because I didn't know that it was a regular occurrence on the ship. Hopefully a false alarm like this won't happen again."</strong> he admitted softly, his voice tinged with remorse. As they made their way inside, Xueyi settled into a chair opposite him while Tomoe next to him, a sheepish expression adorning his features. <strong>"May I see the tools?"</strong> he inquired politely, looking at the Ryu expectedly.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1223731515226325184"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/329264780986548224/a_c188ec2a463f8f6d6f40ceee67637020.gif" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: eg0istic.

What a spitfire this one was. He slowed down as Xueyi tugged on his sleeve, and made their intentions known. 

"Sure. You go do that." 

A raise of his hand acknowledged the request. Enyo then turned away, sparing one last glance over his shoulder. He made headway into the beckoning doors of the pagoda. 

"First floor. You'll see me right away."

His voice faded with the growing distance. Enyo disappeared under the shadow of fretwork and transom thresholds. Epidermis of creaking wood softened after years of exposure to sea spray, but remained sturdy nonetheless. 

The edifice was tall and narrow. Each tier housed a small room. But for Xueyi's sake, Enyo decided to sit somewhere nearby inside, no need to tease their fledgling doctor any more than he already did. And yet, that was a half-truth. It was too late. Unbeknownst to Xueyi, Enyo's interest was piqued. That rather adorable reaction earlier sealed the deal. Xueyi was going to be targeted from now on. 

--

After Tomoe was taken in stride, Enyo was already settled inside the antechamber of the pagoda. He sat on a small round table, with a few empty stools already stationed for Tomoe and Xueyi. 

It was dimmer in here. Most of its lighting came from the lanterns outside, filtering in residual glow through the open doors or the decorative carved ranma panels ribboned on the walls. 

Despite the base floor being the most spacious one, it was nothing special compared to fancier balconies at the very top. This was a holding area for more delicate cargo. Crates piled in the corner, full of rarer liquers and alchemical cordials. Because of the value, these were repacked by them into crates provided by the shipping company. Inventory crewmen littered this area, they dressed similarly to those working for the ship's maneuvers outside, but the wear and tear on their clothes was decidedly less. 
<strong> </strong></p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1224057913715458088"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, April 1, 2024 02:09:08 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1224057913715458088">02:09:08</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-56">They had a clever way of making the crates have locking interstices, so that they stuck together when stacked vertically. 

So that was what the bulk of the crowd in here was doing. Grunts knelt on the floor, lifting the delicate products and stuffing filler in to keep them from bumping around in-transit. Two clerks were roaming around with a clipboard, ensuring none dared take a cut off their merchandise. Noticeably, these supervisors were garbed in the same colors Enyo wore. Sea green and black. Though theirs didn't have the gold trimmings or the expensive material (and neither did it have an appallingly revealing décolletage) that Enyo wore.

Other than that, huge steamer trunks were chained to pegs on the ground. These couldn't be piled uniformly. Not that there were many to begin with. Several inches of thick wood housed their most lucrative trades. Yards of silk fabric woven from joroōgumo spiderthread. Unpolished cabochons from bloodmines--so-called due to the high mortality rate its miners suffered. And likely gold bullions, though that wasn't for sale. Servicing as a neutral go-between for various gangs, Haraita would sometimes ferry liquidated assets for them. That meant lugging around their dirty money. Gold was much more compact a form if they were dealing in the "-ions" of currency. 

That was primarily how Enyo developed an interest in gems and precious metals in the first place.

She held a telescoping prod, which stretched its entire length down at the snap of her wrist. Sparks of electricity jumped on the metal prod, an intimidating display to the errant crewmate she cornered, who sputtered jittery excuses for being caught stealing a skein of the jorō-silk. 

Mages. The cargo supervisors could wield magic. Nonchalant of what was going on, Enyo ignored what was happening in the background. This was his normal. And either way, he didn't feel as threatened as mortals would be to have mages as subordinates. 

Dragonhide had a passive resistance to magic, after all. 

Enyo twirled a pen in his gloved hand. He sat cross-legged, one booted foot was crossed over the opposite knee. Enyo pored attention over a document on the table. Because the moment he stepped within speaking distance of the clerks, they handed him paperwork that needed his signature.

The carpet bag he gave to Genji was here, retrieved after he sought for it again. The design was of muted green acanthus leaves and swooping pastel magpies, obscured by a dusty film that suggested it had seen regular use. 

"Mm. Hey," Enyo greeted distractedly. One hand signed on the dotted line, while the other smacked down the lip of the carpet bag. Without looking, he snapped the clasp open. "Good you're here too, Tomoe. You should get familiar with this, since you'll be assisting Chu-san." 

Finally, those ice blue eyes swept up to Xueyi's face. Simultaneously, his hand dug in to retrieve the first object in the carpet bag. 

<span style="font-style:italic">Thud.</span> 

Tomoe jolted at the sound.

It wasn't forceps, pliers, saws. Or any of the usual tangible things Isawa had on hand for a typical, completely physical injury.

Enyo laid a leatherbound tome down on the table. Books before equipment. The building blocks before its conduits. 

A *grimoire*.

That meant all manner of ailments, magical or non, were under Xueyi's scope. But for a job that needed a jack-of-all trades, it was in its lack of specialty that made up its own complexity. The book on the table was both several inches thick and wide enough to nearly span Enyo's forearm. Comically huge, even for Xueyi. Carrying it would require both hands for the nymph. 

"I guess it's a good thing you have some magic up your sleeve," he began as a precursor, "Makes it easier to get you used to this."</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1224058080443105290"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/469718795393433610/31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6.jpeg" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: zephtre

His slender fingers gently caressed the weathered leather cover of the tome, tracing the intricate patterns etched into its surface with a reverence reserved for ancient relics. Each stroke felt like a silent invocation to the gods of wisdom and knowledge, a humble plea for guidance in the pursuit of healing arts.

As he gingerly opened the grimoire, the pages unfurled with a soft rustle, yielding to his touch like the unfolding petals of a revered lotus blossom. Within its pages lay a treasure trove of timeless wisdom, of texts and diagrams that spoke volumes of the countless remedies and treatments for wounds, both mundane and magical. Each word seemed to dance before his eyes, weaving a symphony of knowledge that resonated deep within his soul.

The grimoire itself was a marvel of craftsmanship, its impressive size a testament to the vastness of its contents. Xueyi couldn't help but marvel at how Isawa-san, despite being human, managed to carry such a tome and delve into its depths during his leisure moments. It was a testament to the doctor's dedication and expertise, a testament to the boundless depths of his knowledge.

<strong>"Thank you,"</strong> Xueyi murmured, his voice carrying a quiet intensity that resonated in the hallowed chamber. <strong>"Undoubtedly, it will take time for me to get used to injuries of such nature. But this tome can now serve as a guide to me, preparing me for the day when the knowledge will be needed comes."</strong> He nodded, offering another grateful smile to Enyo, his fingers caressing the weathered pages of the grimoire. The scent of ancient parchment invoked memories of nights spent immersed in the healing arts, under the guidance of his family. A nostalgic warmth enveloped him, his touch on the book growing increasingly tender.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1224728774105366528"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Tuesday, April 2, 2024 22:34:54 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1224728774105366528">22:34:54</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-61">[+]

As he delved deeper into the secrets held within the grimoire, Xueyi felt a surge of exhilaration coursing through him, akin to molten fire flowing through his veins. Each page unfolded like a revelation, offering glimpses of untold wisdom waiting to be uncovered. It was a journey of discovery, a quest for truth and enlightenment that promised to shape his destiny for years to come.

With every word he absorbed, Xueyi found himself immersed in a sense of wonder and awe, his appreciation for the mysteries of the universe deepening with each passing moment. The magical wounds inflicted by the creatures of the sea lay beyond his expertise, presenting a humbling challenge that reminded him of the vast expanse of knowledge yet to be explored. Yet, it also imbued him with a sense of empowerment, a realization that even the most modest of souls held the potential to effect profound change in the world.

As he immersed himself in the wisdom of the ancients, Xueyi felt a profound sense of gratitude welling up within him, a deep-seated appreciation for the opportunity to embark on this sacred journey of self-discovery. With each passing moment, he could feel himself being able to learn and grow even wiser in this journey, his spirit expanding to embrace the infinite possibilities that lay before him.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1224728931513536512"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Tuesday, April 2, 2024 22:35:31 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1224728931513536512">22:35:31</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-62">[+]

As Xueyi raised his gaze from the ancient pages of the grimoire, a newfound resolve shone in his eyes, as if each word he absorbed had ignited a flame of determination within him. <strong>"I reckon it would be quite the challenge to bring this around. I'll keep this in my room later, to study when I have the time,"</strong> he remarked, his voice steady and filled with a quiet confidence. With a gentle gesture, he angled the grimoire slightly towards Tomoe, inviting her to explore its contents as well. <strong>"If it's not too much trouble, it would be nice if you were to study these as well. Having an extra mind to remember all these crucial information would no doubt bring peace to my mind,"</strong> he added, his tone soft and reassuring, mindful not to overwhelm the young girl.

Turning his attention back to Enyo, Xueyi leaned forward slightly, resting his arms on the table as he locked eyes with the bursar. <strong>"Enyo-xiansheng, since I had just gone through an unnecessary embarrassment just now, perhaps now would be the perfect time for you to explain all that is to know, to make sure I am not missing out on anything, and potentially panicking over an imaginary threat as before?"</strong> he proposed, a playful glint dancing in his eyes. Despite the seriousness of his request, there was an underlying sense of amusement in his tone, indicating that he had already moved past the incident, and no offense was taken at all.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1224729158823973066"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Tuesday, April 2, 2024 22:36:25 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1224729158823973066">22:36:25</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-63">[+]

Indeed, the tentacle's sudden emergence had triggered Xueyi's instinctual "flight" response, prompting him to act without fully understanding the situation. Reflecting on it now, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of relief that his reaction hadn't caused any harm to the ship or its occupants. After all, damaging the bio-mechanism that powered the vessel would have been a much more significant problem to contend with. Yet, even as he acknowledged the gravity of the situation, Xueyi maintained a lighthearted demeanour, preferring to approach the matter with a sense of curiosity rather than dwelling on past mistakes.

In truth, Xueyi's inquiry served multiple purposes. Not only did he seek clarification to avoid similar episodes in the future, but he also aimed to deepen his understanding of their surroundings and the potential dangers they might encounter on their journey. By engaging Enyo in conversation, he hoped to foster a sense of camaraderie and mutual trust, knowing that a strong bond between them would be essential for navigating the challenges that lay ahead. And so, with a playful smile gracing his lips, Xueyi awaited Enyo's response, eager to glean insights that would guide them on their shared path.

"Mm-hm," she answered shyly, intimidated by the breadth of the book. 

A swing of that to the head could probably take someone out. Its brown, leather-tooled cover and worn vellum pages harkened back to its age. Haraita was an old company.

This ship doctor's manual saw a change of hands across several lifetimes. It was a growing body of text. New chapters were sewn in fresh vellum, annotated by previous doctors who held this book. Sections were divided up by the type of arcana: from Greco-Egyptian Hermetica, condensed Mandaic phylactery scriptures, to Mu-gyo incantations. Despite its density, it was succinct in purpose. It did not contain diatribes of what each magical discipline was, only simpler formulations for the uninitiated. Naturally, that meant it was a tome focusing on potions and alchemical elixirs. Ailments were arranged alphabetically per arcana, organized by the type of ailment or afflicting creature, and the corresponding treatments available. 

Oddly enough, even the oldest sections followed a Diagnosis to Prognosis format. But that slip of modernity was due to the conditions of working aboard a ship. Patients were near, repetitive, and thus had a continuous line of care. That was completely different to healing on land centuries ago, where the most rural inlands were lucky to have a herbalist in their village, if they were even the type to settle.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1225537190705107016"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, April 5, 2024 04:07:15 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1225537190705107016">04:07:15</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-65">Enyo chuckled at the enthusiasm, knowing full well that it would take Tomoe a while to get used to this. She could read and write, but not her literacy was at a basic level. 

He pulled his hand out from the carpet bag, retrieving a tool organizer in a thin roll-up of leather. It was full of picks, screws, forceps, and scalpels of varied edges. 

"You have three kinds of ships," he began his grossly over-simplified explanation, "First's your typical human made ones. Nothing special about those. Second purely of magical powersource, mana cores for fuel. Boats of old, you'll only ever hear about those ones in textbooks these days. Lastly, is both of those combined. We're looking at something that's in-between." 

Enyo pulled out the last two items. One was a brass Ohm bowl, which relieved the big carpet bag of its weight. While the other was lighter, but  relieved it of its bulky shape. A lacquered, mini apothecary cabinet. These completed all the items Isawa bequeathed to his replacement. Enyo pushed the objects closer to Xueyi's side. While he was going to return it all back into the bag for transport, he allowed the new doctor to get a headstart familiarizing with them. 

He leaned in and placed his elbows on the table. Interlocking his fingers, Enyo cradled his chin and smiled.

"This." 

The heavy heel of his boot thudded solidly on the floor. 

"Isn't our main vessel. We're on a supply ship. But Haraita's made out of the same material. Those tentacles you saw earlier? It's as much part of the ship as the rudder is." 

He glanced away for a second, watching the workers mill about whilst explaining. 

"The ship's alive because it's part yokai. It's called a koromodako. Small buggers. But the females can get massive. Some ships get an aspidochelone fused to their underside, but its all the same principle. It's hard to see underwater. Once we pass by the dry docks I'll point some out to you."

It was more than just a book; it was a living testament to the wisdom and knowledge passed down through generations of healers. Each chapter seemed to whisper secrets of the past, its words a bridge connecting him to healers long gone. He imagined the hands that had once held this tome, the minds that had poured over its pages in search of solutions to the myriad ailments that plagued humanity. It was a sacred duty, he realized, a calling that transcended time and space.

The organization of the manual spoke volumes about the meticulous care with which it had been curated over the centuries. From Greco-Egyptian Hermetica to Mu-gyo incantations, each section represented a different facet of arcana knowledge, a treasure trove waiting to be unlocked. Xueyi marveled at the ingenuity of those who had compiled this vast repository of wisdom, their efforts immortalized within its pages.

Despite its density, the manual remained surprisingly accessible, its language straightforward and concise. It was a testament to the practicality of its creators, who had foregone elaborate explanations in favor of simple formulations that even the uninitiated could understand. Xueyi admired their pragmatism, recognizing the value of clarity and precision in the field of healing.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1226305751744516219"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, April 7, 2024 07:01:14 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1226305751744516219">07:01:14</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-69">[+]

The inclusion of a Diagnosis to Prognosis format in the oldest sections was a nod to the realities of shipboard medicine. In an environment where patients were near and care was continuous, such a format made perfect sense. Xueyi couldn't help but contrast this with the challenges faced by healers on land centuries ago, where access to medical care was limited and resources scarce. It was a stark reminder of how far they had come, and how much they owed to those who had come before.

He listened as the Ryu spoke of the three distinct categories of ships, keeping his eyes on the man as a sign that he was listening. With each word, he painted a picture of the different types of ships that traversed the vast expanse of the sea. Xueyi leaned in, eager to absorb every morsel of wisdom that Enyo had to offer.

As Enyo pulled out the brass Ohm bowl and the lacquered apothecary cabinet, Xueyi's eyes widened with curiosity. These were not just ordinary objects; they were tools of the trade, each imbued with its own significance and purpose. He reached out tentatively, his fingers brushing against the smooth surface of the Ohm bowl before moving on to the intricate carvings of the cabinet. With a sense of curiosity, the Nymph set to work familiarizing himself with the tools laid out before him. He examined each item with care, committing its purpose and function to memory. There was a certain satisfaction in the act of learning, a sense of empowerment that came from mastering new skills and knowledge.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1226305994934452324"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, April 7, 2024 07:02:12 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1226305994934452324">07:02:12</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-70">[+]

As the resounding echo of Enyo's boot striking the ship's wooden planks reverberated through the air, Xueyi's senses sharpened, drawing him back to the present moment. His gaze, once lost in the detailed patterns of the cabinet, now refocused on the bursar, awaiting the next disclosure about the vessel they sailed upon. The revelation that this ship wasn't the main vessel sent a chill down Xueyi's spine, causing him to ponder the sheer scale of the ship he currently stood upon. If this ship was already massive to the Nymph, what behemoth lay beyond the horizon?

Enyo's words continued to weave intrigue and wonder inside of Xueyi's mind, each revelation adding a new layer of complexity to the ship's enigmatic nature. The notion of genders among the actual ships elicited a furrow of Xueyi's brow, his mind racing to comprehend the implications of such a concept. <strong>"They have.. genders."</strong> A pause, an even deeper furrow of his brows present.

<strong>"So... they reproduce to create... other bio-mechanical ships?"</strong> Xueyi's voice, barely above a whisper, betrayed his bewilderment as he voiced his question. His head tilted to the side, an obvious gesture of confusion as he sought to unravel the mysteries hidden within the depths of the ship's lore.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1226306009656590416"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/329264780986548224/a_c188ec2a463f8f6d6f40ceee67637020.gif" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: eg0istic.

"The one we're in is a boy, mind you."

He watched as Tomoe gingerly snuck her hands over to one of the items on the table. Sensing his gaze, she looked to him warily. But there was no reproach in his eyes. Those were, after all, now Xueyi's tools. And if she was to help him, it was better she get used them now. 

Enyo continued to speak to Xueyi, "And we don't call Haraita the mothership for nothing. This is her baby. Not real sure <span style="font-style:italic">how</span> they breed, but I've heard they don't need a mate to spawn." 

In the background, Tomoe jolted as she opened a hidden drawer in the apothecary cabinet. It sprung out abruptly, and revealed vials full of small eggs and cocoons in preservative solutions. She looked them over in fascination. 

"And no, they don't come attacked to a ship. They start about yay big," Enyo tapped down on the round table they sat at, "At birth. Can stretch about as wide as this room."

The storage room they were in wasn't small by any means. To stretch from something the diameter of their table to the entire space here was a feat by itself. But that was nothing compared to covering hundreds of meters for an entire flagship. 

Enyo collapsed his arms down, to resume the paperwork he'd momentarily abandoned. 

"I'm no expert on it. I know they use mages for the fusion process. Barquemasters, they're called," the sound of his pen scratched on rough paper, "Bunch of weirdos if you ask me. The one that made Haraita died a long, <span style="font-style:italic">long</span> time ago. There's lots of them in the dockyard now. I'll point them out to you when we get there."

It was shaped like the bulbous end of an alembic. Inside, its contents shimmered an opalescent, turquoise hue. Any slight movement agitated it. Currents were visible. A rheoscopic fluid, with its threads of silver, cyan and sea green, scintillated restlessly inside. Tomoe stared. Within that cloud of shifting liquid, she could sworn the impressions of tiny faces formed, stretched into languid yet horrifically contorted yawns. They didn't last for long. Effervescent as the sea. 

A compulsion to open it overtook her. Her other hand clasped the screwcap. 

"I wouldn't open that if I were you." 

Enyo chuckled, flitting his gaze back down to his paperwork. 

That snapped her out of that trance-like state. Embarrassed, Tomoe stuck the bottle back into the drawer. It clanked shut. 

"You'll have to keep this one mindful of handling these," the dragonshifter addressed Xueyi again, "I doubt Isawa left us a bomb, but it pays to be careful with the concoctions. I don't know what half of those do. I'm afraid you'll have to read his notes. He still has them in his office desk."</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1227230254427406419"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/469718795393433610/31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6.jpeg" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: zephtre

The revelation of Haraita being considered the "mothership" and the ship they were on as its "baby" stirred within Xueyi a profound sense of reverence for the interconnectedness of life aboard the vessel. He couldn't help but marvel at the intricate balance between nature and magic that sustained their floating sanctuary. Yet, amidst the enlightenment brought by this newfound knowledge, a disturbing realization settled within Xueyi's mind. The notion of a ship "giving birth" to a smaller vessel stirred a feeling of unease within him, shrouding his thoughts in an unsettling fog of apprehension.

As Tomoe tentatively explored the tools laid out before them, Xueyi watched with awe, the tools and items in the apothecary cabinet brought a sense of pride and responsibility in him. These were now his tools, entrusted to him by Isawa-san, and he vowed to wield them with care and expertise. The thought of delving into Isawa's notes filled him with anticipation, eager to unravel the secrets hidden within the ship's archives and carry on the legacy of healing aboard Haraita.

Enyo's mention of barquemasters and their role in the fusion process piqued Xueyi's interest, sparking a desire to learn more about these mysterious figures and their connection to the ship's mystical origins. His gaze lingered on the paperwork in Enyo's hands, a silent reminder of the wealth of knowledge waiting to be uncovered within the ship's vast repository.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1228059277487247462"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Friday, April 12, 2024 03:09:07 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1228059277487247462">03:09:07</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-76">[+]

Amidst the conversation, Tomoe's fascination with a vial of rheoscopic fluid caught Xueyi's attention. The swirling colors and hypnotic movements of the liquid held a mesmerizing allure, drawing him into a trance-like state as he contemplated the mysteries it contained. Enyo's warning snapped both Xueyi and Tomoe out of their reverie, a sobering reminder of the potential dangers lurking within the confines of the ship's cargo.

<strong>"I'll handle them with care. And I'll be sure to watch her carefully as well."</strong> Xueyi assured, his voice carrying a solemn vow to uphold the trust placed in him by Isawa-san and his predecessors, but also of embarrassment for being caught in a trance-like state. If he was so easily mesmerized as Tomoe, who will protect her from the dangers if not him? 

Shaking his head, he focused his mind to something else. The prospect of delving into the grimoire filled him with a sense of purpose, fuelling his determination to become the healer that Haraita and its crew deserved. With a nod of gratitude towards Enyo, Xueyi turned his attention back to the tools before him, his mind already racing with possibilities of the knowledge that awaited him. As he reached for the nearest instrument, a surge of determination coursed through him, propelling him forward on his journey of discovery and enlightenment.

In that moment, amidst the quiet hum of the ship and the gentle creaking of its timbers, Xueyi felt a burgeoning sense of camaraderie with his fellow crewmates. They were bound together not only by the vast expanse of the sea but also by a shared purpose: to safeguard the wellbeing of those who called Haraita home.

As he readied himself for the journey ahead aboard the ship, Xueyi acknowledged the inevitability of challenges and obstacles awaiting him. Yet, he harboured hope that, much like the resilient seasalt breeze that swept over the ship, he would weather these trials with fortitude and grace.

I look forward to working with with you." 

Despite the smile on his face, it was a lukewarm response. Enyo was bogged down by the attention the papers demanded of him. 

"I'll be stuck with this for a while. Both of you, feel free to explore as much as you'd like."

Chair legs grated on the floor. Tomoe was getting ready to bail out. 

"Ahem. Granted, Xueyi-san <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> accompany you. Savvy?" 

Tomoe made a sound that was half between her agreeing, and a grumbling complaint. She her crossed her arms petulantly. 

"No buts. Topmost floor's off-limits and you know it," Enyo reprimanded without taking his eyes off the contracts, "Don't even try sneaking in there. I'll know. I have eyes on the back of my head." It was obviously an exaggeration on his part. Enyo didn't actually have an extra pair, but he might as well, from how informed he was about the ongoings of the ship. For both here and its larger vessel. The topmost floors were reserved as smoking and pleasure rooms, and Haraita took the same principle as well. <span style="font-style:italic">Ukiyo,</span> was what the sailors called it. Places where the wispy curls of opium and hashish fogged the air, where the rest of those painted streetwalkers lurked. 

There were things in his life that he regretted. One was a premature exposure in his teens. A lifestyle like that nearly ruined him. And to this day, Enyo couldn't fully be rid of his addictions. 

To no surprise, he assiduously forbid Tomoe from getting anywhere near it. Killjoy. Shrew. Prig. She turned her gaze to Xueyi, her pointed look and pouty face was accusing her new guardian to be complicit in this.

But of course, she was blissfully ignorant. All Tomoe understood was that the bursar was being a pain in the ass again. 

"I'll be here."

But once the horn sounded, the ructions and rumblings of before were roused.

With the Ryu's words echoing in his mind, Xueyi pondered for a moment. Enyo seemed absorbed in his work, but the Nymph sensed that he could use the company if he were to stay. And truth be told, Xueyi himself was hesitant to venture alone without (Enyo) a guide, especially onto unfamiliar territory like a ship.

Yet, curiosity sparked within him. He had never set foot on a boat before—wasn't this an opportunity to explore and learn something new? Besides, Tomoe was stuck with him, and she seemed eager to explore the ship. Though Enyo had mentioned that this vessel was smaller than the mothership, to Xueyi, it was plenty large already. He mused that once he had set foot on the grander vessel, perhaps the flame of curiosity for this one would be extinguished, replaced by something even bigger.

Deciding to seize the opportunity, Xueyi rose from his seat, pushing his chair in with a gentle nudge. <strong>"Good luck with your paperwork, xiansheng. I'll return with Tomoe later,"</strong> he said with a smile, nodding at the little girl. Xueyi chuckled softly as he saw the evident pout on the girl's face, quick to reassure her. <strong>"There must be a reason for it. He's... questionable, but I doubt he'd forbid you from exploring just because he's mean,"</strong> Xueyi whispered, patting her head with a gentle smile as they exited the room, closing the door behind them.

As they wandered through the maze of crates and barrels on deck, Xueyi observed the quiet activity of the crew during their journey. Sailors lounged around, attending to minor tasks or engaging in casual conversations. Ropes hung loosely, and the occasional creak of timber filled the air. The scent of salt and sea mingled with the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the crew's quarters.

Descending below deck, Xueyi and Tomoe explored the cramped quarters where the crew ate, slept, and passed the time at sea. Dimly lit corridors were lined with hammocks swaying gently with the ship's motion, and the air was heavy with the smell of tar and oil. As they passed through the cargo hold, Xueyi and Tomoe marveled at the diverse array of goods from distant lands—spices, silks, and exotic fruits—a testament to the extensive trade networks of seafaring merchants.

Emerging back on deck, Xueyi felt a sense of gratitude towards Tomoe for her companionship and guidance. Though the ship may not have been grand, its rugged beauty and promise of adventure called to him, beckoning him to explore the vast unknown of the open sea.

Suddenly, the klaxons sounded, signaling the ship's approach to port. Xueyi's eyes widened in surprise as he realized how quickly time had passed. <strong>"Let's return to Enyo, Tomoe,"</strong> the Nymph said, taking her hand and leading her back to the room where they had left the Ryu. Opening the door slowly, they entered carefully as to not disrupt the bursar's focus if the man was still working on his documents. If Enyo was indeed still working, they would sit on take their seats on the table again without a word- but if he wasn't, Xueyi would greet him with a smile and a little wave.

<strong>"We've arrived, or so it seems,"</strong> he said cheerfully, clearly elated of his discoveries of the ship during his exploration.

Or atleast, whatever he deemed needed his immediate attention. The rest were stuffed back into their respective folders and envelopes, slimming the files down to manageable bundles. He'd taken the liberty of storing Xueyi's tools back in too. 

So what was he up to before?

Enyo had an elbow propped up on the table. His left glove rested beside it, the bare hand cradled a phone. Scales of white ran along the contours of his palm and wrist, ridged at the knuckles. He was still in his rut anyhow, albeit managed with suppressants in time, and it was oft displayed by traits like these manifesting in patches. 

He pouted while staring at the screen, thumbing idly through a log of missed calls and unanswered messages. <span style="font-style:italic">His</span> ones, actively sent, with most left ignored. Enyo was a stubborn man. He sulked with a heave of breath, or a dramatic rub at his temples. 

"Oh," he acknowledged Xueyi and Tomoe's returned as they neared him, Enyo snapped back into a practiced smile, "And so we have." 

Pocketing his phone, he took the glove and slid it back on. 

"I didn't think you'd come back on the dot," he chuckled, hands pressing on the table as he stood up. Enyo scooped the documents into one arm, while the other hand grabbed he carpet bag. Enyo tookt he first step around. "C'mon. I'll point out the ship to you," he urged with a nod of his head over his shoulder. From thence on, he headed out of the storage room. Enyo nudged it open, as more sailors poured in to prepare the cargo for transferral. 

Overhead, the bleat of the klaxon died down.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1231312204528091258"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, April 21, 2024 02:35:06 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1231312204528091258">02:35:06</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-84">Tomoe, for all the little bit of attitude she showed earlier, was relatively obedient. She didn't stray from Xueyi. And still now, she had no plans to. 

The young girl looked up to her impromptu guardian, and then tucked a small hand into Xueyi's pocket. She begrudgingly allowed the handhold earlier, but a sense of pride remained instilled. She wasn't <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> young. 

Or perhaps that was the effect of the other teens onboard. Some were sailors, others temporarily hired ruffians like her, sneering and making faces a while ago. And so, she would follow, like a shadow trailing in Xueyi's footsteps. But with her hands purposely hidden out of reach, besides the small fingers latching at Xueyi's pocket.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1231312268965183541"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/469718795393433610/31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6.jpeg" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: zephtre

He couldn't help but wonder what troubled the usually confident and composed bursar, his curiosity piqued by the subtle display of frustration etched upon Enyo's countenance. The object of his vexation undoubtedly lay within the confines of the device held in his hand just moments before— perhaps it was an urgent message from his upset mother, or the weight of unanswered messages from a distant lover. Though Enyo did not strike him as the type to be tethered to commitments of the heart, the Ryu remained a creature of mystery, and nothing was beyond the realm of possibility in such matters.

Despite the tumult swirling beneath the surface of his thoughts, Enyo's smile swiftly returned, a facade carefully crafted to conceal the storm brewing within. It was a mask of congeniality, worn effortlessly as they approached, veiling whatever inner turmoil he might have been experiencing. Typical two-faced behavior of the bursar, from Xueyi's observations thus far. Recognizing that it was not his place to pry into the intricacies of another's private affairs, Xueyi maintained his facade of obliviousness, a shield against the discomfort that often accompanied unsolicited prying.

As soon as I was done exploring the ship, the klaxon sounded."</strong> he remarked, his voice laced with a gentle amusement. <strong>"It seems the sea has a penchant for punctuality."</strong> Turning his gaze towards the young girl at his side, Xueyi's lips curved into a fond smile. She clung steadfastly to his pocket, a silent testament to her burgeoning independence, her pout evidence to her determination. <strong>"Stay close, 小可爱 , || little cutie ||"</strong> he murmured softly, choosing to humor her show of independence instead. With a gentle ruffle to her hair and his own luggage in tow, Xueyi followed in the wake of the Ryu, his steps deliberate as they traversed out of the storage room.

Emerging from the storage room, Xueyi's gaze swept over the bustling deck, his eyes alight with curiosity at the sight unfolding before him. The sailors moved with practiced efficiency, their motions a symphony of coordinated effort as they prepared for the journey ahead. In the distance, smaller vessels trailed in the wake of the mothership, like loyal attendants in the grand procession of the sea. And as Xueyi beheld the vast size of the 'Haraita' before him, he marvelled at the sheer magnitude of it, the ship looming over the horizon like a titan of the seas, its imposing silhouette cutting through the waves with an air of majesty and power.

To the teen, she was subject to these a lot. So much so, that Tomoe found them patronizing and unbearable. 

*What nerve!*, Tomoe protested mentally. But all that came out of it was a nose-scrunching pout and a little huff. Because of her rather... <span style="font-style:italic">endearing</span> demeanor, it came as no surprise that nobody took her harrumphing seriously. All the other sailors saw was a teapot small girl, and not the growing, developing woman she was. At the head of it was Enyo. He was the worst, the utterly strictest of them all. 

She was not pleased at the prospect of Xueyi becoming an extension of the bursar's control. 

And yet, she clung on to the pocket anyway. Perhaps as a sort of umbrella for protection, because the younger sailors - most of which were just a little bit older than her - sniggered as they passed by her. They daren't jeer loudly at her this time, not when she stuck close to Xueyi's side.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1233856496199008377"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Sunday, April 28, 2024 03:05:12 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1233856496199008377">03:05:12</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-89">Enyo chuckled as the winds whipped against his skin. Same as their departure before, he had to raise his voice above the din. 

"That's less for punctuality and more for the eyes up there."

His gloved hand pointed at something in the distance. And that <span style="font-style:italic">something</span> was one of two towers standing on either side of the river's mouth.  Stretched across them was a drawbridge, made of grander wrought-iron and steel than the ones inland. The <span style="font-style:italic">"eyes"</span> were a pair of lighthouse beacons, shining their all-seeing gaze on those that passed in and out of the isle. Powerful rays of light grazed briefly over their ship. Up on the towers, shadowy figures could be seen milling about the balconied rungs. No doubt the ones inside the twin spirals were government surveyors. 

With a thunderous, mechanical whirr, the drawbridge's massive girders lifted to permit their passage. 

The boat rocked as they entered choppy estuary waters. Riptides were particularly vicious here. On all sides of their vessel, laps of water licked up the sides of the hull. Waves jumped up so high, that some of the crew were inevitably drenched in seawater. They were used to it. Only the younger ones shivered and grit their chattering teeth. Sailors heaved the winch ropes, which controlled the lateens to flex like a pair of semi-amphibious wings, changing their direction. 

Despite the turbulence, the supply ship cleaved through the riptide, executing a clean turn to the left. 

Churning waters premonitioned a change of scenery. 

"Over here! Come," Enyo urged as he walked over to the larboard side. There were two main areas to the port. First the docking cove, where they were headed, with its landing jetties harboring rows of boats in various shapes and sizes. His arm swept up over the railing, to gesture at the structures that loomed in the port. 

"That's our girl," he confirmed, gesturing at Haraita's enormous swell.

She was moored in the water, her blazing lights shining on brass and gold accents on the gunwale. Ornate carving from several master craftsmen, which all culminated to a gleaming figurehead: A monk, with his face covered by the wide brim of a kasa hat, and his arms raised supplicant to the skies. One hand grasped a shakujo, the other a vajra bell. 

The strangest thing about it, was that it was dressed as a real, living person would be. While its entire body was likely solid gold, the white and teal of its soken and gojo-gesa were definitely made of fabric, as the ceremonial garments were bought instead of carved. Silky black strands of hair cascaded down the umbrage of its hat. Even from far away, one could see its hair sway along with the breeze. 

"We're not going in for repairs, you can't see all of her," Enyo explained, noting to them that Haraita was half in the water and ready to go, once the rest of her crew returned, "Look over there!" 
 
He gestured further inland, away from the marina.  The dry docks was a bustling business of cargo stacks, forklifts and cranes. What caught the eye more though, were the vessels being built kn the shipyard. Reservoirs that were boxes of concrete, whether dried up or filled with water, held ships as gigantic as Haraita. The difference was, the dried up ones fully revealed the structure that was otherwise hidden underwater. 

Enyo pointed at one, with scaffolding scaling either side of its hull. 

"There's one being rigged over there! Same make as she is."

But what mingled with that basic foundation was what Enyo was talking about earlier, the organic component. A huge swathe of <span style="font-style:italic">something</span> clung obstinately to the ship's frame, like ivy grouting walls of brick. Despite the dun color, it didn't look like any sort of fabric or canvas. Instead, there was a surface-level translucence, where thinner branches of red, purple and green could be made out. Veins, arteries. Living tissue crept beneath it, showing striated muscle and tendon. It appeared to be stretched thin, growing ever so slowly to cover gaps in the unfinished hull. 

It led down to a monstrous undergrowth of tentacles. They writhed listlessly. And still lower, were a group of robed mages their arms thrust out to the skies. Where their palms pointed at, the creature grew out in that direction - tissue first, before skin followed it in its wake.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1233857114464714865"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/469718795393433610/31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6.jpeg" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: zephtre

Enyo's words, a narrative against the backdrop of crashing waves, painted vivid images of the sea's secrets and mysteries, captivating Xueyi's imagination like the enchanting tales spun by ancient mariners. His gaze, akin to a sailor navigating the celestial constellations, followed the arc of Enyo's outstretched arm as it pointed towards the towering monoliths that guarded the ocean's mouth, their weathered visage a testament to the enduring spirit of seafaring souls.

The lighthouse beacons, towering sentinels of the coast, cast their radiant beams into the twilight expanse, illuminating the path ahead with silent assurances of safe passage. Xueyi couldn't help but feel a sense of awe for these guardians of the night, their steadfast vigilance guiding wayward ships through treacherous waters without fail. As the drawbridge ascended with a mechanical hum, Xueyi marveled at the intricate dance of gears and pulleys that orchestrated its graceful ascent, a sneak-peek to the craftsmanship and innovation of those who harnessed the elements to tame the wild seas.

The vessel swayed rhythmically as it navigated the turbulent waters, the resilience of both ship and crew coming to light in the face of the sea's violent embrace. Xueyi's fingers, entwined with the worn wood of the railing, felt the pulse of the ocean coursing through the vessel's veins, a tangible reminder of their shared journey across the boundless expanse of the sea. Despite the chaos of the elements, there was a sense of unity among the sailors, their collective efforts obvious even to the eyes of a newcomer.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1235159880931737680"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Wednesday, May 1, 2024 17:24:23 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1235159880931737680">17:24:23</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-94">&gt; 
As they rounded the bend, the bustling activity of the docking cove came into view, a bustling tableau of maritime life as vessels of all shapes and sizes jostled for space along the crowded shoreline. Yet amidst the bustling chaos, it was Haraita, with her scarlet sails billowing like the wings of a magnificent seabird, that captured Xueyi's gaze and held it in rapt attention. The ship's intricate design, an attestation to the craftsmanship of past generations spoke volumes of the seafaring legacy that thrived within her weathered hull.

But it was the dry docks, with their skeletal frames reaching towards the heavens like the ribs of ancient leviathans, that stirred Xueyi's curiosity and ignited his sense of wonder. Among them, one vessel stood out, its hull adorned with a mesmerizing tapestry of organic tendrils that seemed to pulsate with an otherworldly vitality. As he watched the mages channel their arcane energies into the creature below, Xueyi couldn't help but wonder- just how many more boundless mysteries that lay hidden beneath the surface of the sea, waiting to be unveiled by those brave enough to seek them out? 

The Nymph's eyes remained in awe, never once faltering as he beheld the magnificent sight gestured to him by the bursar.  Despite the intricate network of 'arteries' that sent occasional shivers down his spine, it was a testament to the endless wonders awaiting discovery. He marveled at the realization that the world was teeming with untold mysteries, each awaiting exploration beyond the confines of his familiar Emerald Isle home. Gratitude swelled within him for the opportunity to serve as the ship's temporary doctor, a role that not only fulfilled his duties but also granted him access to the vast expanse of the open sea.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1235160121651494954"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Wednesday, May 1, 2024 17:25:21 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1235160121651494954">17:25:21</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-95">&gt; 
<strong>"The... bio-mechanism that keeps the ship going still sends shivers down my spine- but it's undeniably fascinating,"</strong> Xueyi remarked, his gaze drifting towards the intricate workings of the Ryu. <strong>"Merely hours at sea, I've already learned so much. I can't even imagine what else I will find as we embark on weeks- or even a month long journey atop the ship. There will be so much to see."</strong> His smile widened with anticipation, a reflection of the unbridled curiosity that fueled his soul. Yet amidst the excitement, a question stirred in his mind, one that spoke to the practicalities of their journey.

<strong>"How long will it take before we embark on another journey? Or will we only drop off the cargos and make our way again?"</strong> Xueyi inquired, his gaze remained fixed on the nearing shoreline. If opportunity allowed, he wanted to explore the island, searching for the elusive herbs that could add to his inventory.

"We're making headway for Haraita right now." 

The supply ship inched closer and closer to the marina, drawing them away from the sight of the dry docks. Sight of those unfinished shipbuilding faded into the background. It'd only take minutes for them to close in on the main vessel. The closer they were, the more that Haraita's sheer size loomed over them. It dwarfed the size of the ship they were on. 

"We leave in three hours! So buy whatever you need before then. I'll come with you."

They passed the choppy estuary area, and transitioned into the calmer waters of the marina. Its natural cove formation shielded it from turbulence. 

Enyo squinted as he glanced up at the swell of Haraita's hull. Brighter lights, the constant purr of machinery, steam exuding. It emblazoned their deck in a vapor of heat. 

The supply ship cleaved expertly into the space that Haraita occupied between two jetties, squeezing into what little room she could afford to give the smaller ship. With a synchronized tug from the sailors manning the sails, they directed the ship to slowly come to a stop, whereupon the same lateens were pulled back flat against the supply ship's hull. No more side spurs fringing the sides like a lionfish. This close to her, it was important they kept their rigging from getting tangled. Both ships bobbed parallel to each other, mimicking a behemoth whale with its calf close by its side.

Another quake shook the deck. Unseen in the watery depths, tentacles latched on to their mother's bigger tendrils. They spun around each other like a braid, tethering the boat close to its mothership.

Behind them was a rush of a crowd. They poured out of the pagoda, or from the stern where they once loitered in. Droves of men and women in finery gathered. The noise was deafening. He scrunched his face, acutely distressed at how sharp the smell of perfume wafted over to his sensitive nose. People laughed, conversed, shouted boisterously. Sleeves of silk fluttered in the wind. Hat bags, attachés and smaller carry-on luggage was brought along. Everyone was preparing to board. 

Up on Haraita, a sailor waved a small, triangular signal flag. This spurred the supply ship's crew to prepare. Most left to assist the crew lifting the heavier trunks out of the storage room, while a handful stayed by the railing. They unlatched a part of it open, which made it slip aside like a sliding door, creating a gap in the railing.

"It's passengers first before cargo," he alerted Xueyi, his gloved hand grabbed the healer by the wrist, "Let's move before we get squashed." 

He led them closer to the sailors awaiting the boarding plank. 

Higher up on Haraita's hull, a wide door hatch was situationed between two portholes. That door swung open, revealing crewmen carrying a set of folded boarding stairs. 

Both sailors from either side bellowed out commands, signals to inform they were ready and to stand clear. 

With a shout, Haraita's crew threw out the lower half of the stairs. It telescoped out. And landed with a heavy thunk on the supply ship's deck, where the other crewmen below began affixing it to clamps or predetermined grooves on the supply ship. 

One plucky sailor casually walked up to the middle of the stairs. He wobbled dangerously, before crouching. Swarthy hands reached under. Finding purchase on something metallic, he pulled upwards with a grunt. The railing for the stairs unfurled from underneath, clicking into place, after which another man followed suit to turn the screw clamps tight by the edges. The same was done for the other side.

Haraita was ready to accept the new influx of passengers.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1236219153476747317"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/469718795393433610/31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6.jpeg" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: zephtre

As the supply ship inched closer and leaving the sight of the dry docks behind, Xueyi marveled at the grandeur of Haraita- her towering presence dwarfed their current vessel, casting a shadow that seemed to stretch across the entire marina. The contrast between the choppy estuary waters and the calm, protected cove was stark, the transition as smooth as a practiced dance.

Following Enyo's squinting gaze upward, in opposite, Xueyi was met with a sight that took his breath away. The hull of Haraita, bathed in bright lights and shrouded in a haze of steam, seemed almost alive. The constant hum of machinery and the exuding vapor enveloped their deck in a warm, ethereal glow. As their supply ship nestled into the narrow space between Haraita's jetties, Xueyi couldn't help but admire the sailors' expertise. Their synchronized movements, pulling the sails flat against the hull, ensured that their rigging remained untangled in this tight embrace.

A shudder ran through the deck as unseen tentacles from the depths intertwined with Haraita's larger tendrils, securing the smaller vessel like a calf to its mother. It was a strange, almost organic connection, and Xueyi felt a sense of thrill at being able to witness such an intriguing, yet at the same time unsettling monstrosity.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1241831988713881630"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, May 20, 2024 03:16:58 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1241831988713881630">03:16:58</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-101">&gt; 

The atmosphere on deck shifted abruptly as a rush of passengers swarmed from the pagoda and the stern. The cacophony of voices, laughter, and shouted conversations mingled with the rustle of silk sleeves and the clatter of luggage. The overwhelming scent of perfume assaulted his nostrils, and Xueyi's nose visibly scrunched at the discomfort, mirroring the Ryu's own displeasure. 

<strong>"It's passengers first before cargo,"</strong> Enyo said, his gloved hand firmly grasping Xueyi's wrist. The Nymph, although surprised at the sudden hold on his wrist, ended up following Enyo's lead anyway, navigating through the throng of passengers towards the sailors awaiting the boarding plank. High above, a door hatch in Haraita's hull swung open, and crewmen began the intricate process of lowering a set of boarding stairs. Commands were shouted back and forth, ensuring everything was ready and safe for the transfer.

Xueyi watched in awe as the stairs telescoped out and landed with a heavy thunk on their deck. The sailors worked swiftly, securing the railing and testing its stability with a confident smack. The readiness of Haraita to accept her new passengers was signaled by a thumbs up, and Xueyi felt a mixture of excitement and trepidation at the journey ahead.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-7k6pj0" id="1241832942171590819"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1r4mls4"><div class="MuiBox-root css-moni8" title="Monday, May 20, 2024 03:20:45 GMT+8"><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1tauhv0" id="chained-message-1241832942171590819">03:20:45</span></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"></p></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-sdpfzd" id="message-data-102">&gt; 

It was an understatement to say that Xueyi wasn't nervous. He was treading on unfamiliar ground, or rather, unfamiliar waters. The vast expanse of the ocean, a realm he had never explored, stretched out before him, promising both uncertainty and adventure. Despite the initial anxiety that gnawed at him, excitement quickly took its place. Having never set foot on a ship before, the Nymph was enthralled by every little detail, no matter how mundane it seemed to the seasoned sailors around him. Descriptions from movies, documentaries, and books had painted vivid images in his mind, but nothing compared to experiencing the reality—the feel of the ship's texture, the rhythm of its movements, the salty breeze carrying whispers of distant shores. It felt... unreal.

Ready to embark on their journey once more, Xueyi turned his gaze to the bursar, who still held his wrist- recalling that Enyo had mentioned wanting to accompany him if he went ashore to buy any necessities that he might need for their journey. <strong>"I need to purchase some herbs,"</strong> Xueyi said, his voice thoughtful. <strong>"And I just realized I forgot to pack antihistamines, for in case I get seasick. I'm still not quite used to the sea after all."</strong> He chuckled softly, making no effort to pull away from Enyo's grasp. <strong>"Will you come with me?"</strong> he asked with a small, polite smile, knowing the bursar had already offered but wanting to extend the courtesy nonetheless.

"All aboard!" one of the crewmen yelled, taking initiative to usher. 

Yet well before that, the throng pulsed with action. People pushed and pulled in every direction. 

Tomoe despised cramped spaces. 

Xueyi would feel her other hand, grasping at their robes and bunching them up in her little fingers. There was a tug at their pocket again, as though she were bracing herself for something. 

And right as the crowd crashed in to try and shove themselves up to the front, the tugging on Xueyi's clothes disappeared. Poof. Gone, as if she'd never been standing there in the first place. 

It was replaced by the foreign sensation of something soft balled up in Xueyi's pocket. 

In just a second, bodies pressed on either side of them. A chorus of chatter erupted. Like packed sardines, they shimmied along into the funnel of the boarding stairs. Enyo responded by changing his grip. Instead of Xueyi's wrist, he slung an arm around their back, hand clasped on one shoulder to bring the nymph in close. So they could shuffle together without jostling about too much. 

"Yeah, I said I would. Didn't I?" he spoke through the ruckus, dipping his head slightly for Xueyi to hear him better, "I'll show you to your cabin and drop your things there. We can save the tour when we get back!" 

Once directly at the foot of the stairs, Enyo pushed Xueyi in front of him. The bridge was narrow. It could take two, but only barely, to ferry themselves across. 

The hold on Xueyi's shoulder remained for assurance. However, Enyo noticed the apparent lack of their assistant latching onto them.

Where's she run off to now?" he groused,  flicking his head back to survey the crowd. Still, Enyo couldn't help but keep moving. They all did, from the pressure of the crowd swelling upwards. He shuffled right behind Xueyi, inching while the others ahead slid into Haraita's awaiting hatch doors. 

He didn't see that Tomoe was with them all along. A mousy squeak protested in Xueyi's pocket, as Tomoe was squished inside. Some plucky kid tried to squeeze his way past Xueyi. Annoyed, the fluffy  rodent slipped out of the pocket, and quickly climbed her way up along Xueyi's back. Dexterous paws knew just where to dig in those nails in. It must've felt ticklish through the layers of fabric.

With a final leap, Tomoe ended up on Xueyi's shoulder.</p><div class="MuiStack-root css-bi4jru"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-v8tzux"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-rhlj79"></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-py77qc" id="1245428702893047888"><div class="MuiStack-root css-u65wey"><div class="MuiBox-root css-3ujwbx"><img src="../avatars/469718795393433610/31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6.jpeg" class="css-jv1cl1"></div><div class="MuiStack-root css-1rtr3sq"><div class="MuiStack-root css-1hqfxpd"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 css-1n4529e"><strong title="Username: zephtre
